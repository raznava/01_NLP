S4_00019.pdf,"Preparation, physicochemical characterization, and AC induction heating properties of colloidal aggregates of ferrimagnetic cobalt ferrite nanoparticles coated with a bio-compatible polymer","College, Changanassery, Kerala, 686101, India  b Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, Kerala, 686560, India  c Smart Materials Section, Materials Characterization Group, Metallurgy and Materials Group, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu,  603102, India  d Homi Bhabha National Institute, Training School Complex, Anushaktinagar, Mumbai, 400094, India    A R T I C L E  I N F O    Handling Editor: Dr P. Vincenzini   Keywords:  Magnetic fluid hyperthermia  Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles  Magnetic nano-aggregates  Chitosan  Specific absorption rate  A B S T R A C T    AC induction heating properties of colloidal nano-aggregates of ferrimagnetic cobalt ferrite magnetic nano- particles (MNPs) are reported in this study. Bio-compatible chitosan polymer-coated CoFe2O4 MNPs are syn- thesized using a co-precipitation method. Powder X-ray diffraction indicates the formation of mixed spinel  structures for the uncoated (CP) and chitosan-coated (CP–CHN) MNPs, which is also supported by the cation  distributions obtained from the M¨ossbauer spectra. The presence of chitosan coating on the surface of the CP-  CHN MNPs is confirmed using X-ray photoelectron and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies. Transmission electron microscopy shows primary particle sizes of ~13 nm, which is larger than the super- paramagnetic size limit of the CoFe2O4 MNPs. Hence, the CP and CP-CHN MNPs exhibit ferrimagnetic behaviour  at room temperature with estimated saturation magnetization values of ~77.4 emu/g and ~74.4 emu/g,  respectively. The average hydrodynamic diameter is found to be ~90 ± 8 nm for an aqueous dispersion of the  CP-CHN MNPs, which indicate the formation of colloidal nano-aggregates due to the ferrimagnetic interaction of  the primary MNPs. The CP-CHN sample exhibits a significantly high AC induction heating efficiency of ~267.2  ± 4.0 W/gFe, where the higher heating efficiency is attributed to the combination of hysteresis and relaxation-  mediated magneto-thermal energy conversion, as confirmed using Stoner-Wohlfarth model-based dynamic  hysteresis loop calculations. Further, the heating efficiency decreases with increasing sample concentration due  to an increase in dipolar interaction, which is confirmed using semi-empirical calculations, where a lowering of  the initial susceptibility is observed at higher concentrations. The higher AC induction heating efficiency,  coupled with the demonstrated significant bio-compatibility during in vitro cytotoxicity studies, make the cobalt  ferrite nano-aggregates potential candidates for magnetic hyperthermia. ","However, the AC induc- tion heating properties of other types of mixed ferrite MNPs, like  CuFe2O4, NiFe2O4, ZnFe2O4, MgFe2O4 and MnFe2O4 have been exploi- ted for MFH applications [7,8], where alloying with a magnetically  softer or harder element results in a proportionate change in the  major/minor loop areas, thereby influencing the AC magnetic field  induced heating efficiency of the MNPs [6,9]. Amongst various ferrite  MNPs, cobalt ferrite MNPs exhibit several unique properties, viz., high  saturation magnetization (~90% of magnetite), room temperature  ferrimagnetism, good physicochemical stability, high Curie tempera- ture, and one order higher magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy den- sity [10], which have attracted huge research interest for possible  bio-medical applications of cobalt ferrite MNPs. Surface functionalized  CoFe2O4 MNPs have exhibited suitability for various bio-medical fields,  viz., magneto-thermal drug delivery [11], magnetic resonance imaging  [12,13], and MFH [3,14–19]. Recently, the viscosity-independent MFH  efficiency was demonstrated for ultrafine CoFe2O4 MNPs with N`eel  dominated relaxation mode [20]. A combination of relaxation and  hysteresis-mediated heating modes has made CoFe2O4 MNPs efficient  candidates for MFH applications [21]. Further, it has been reported that  the anisotropy constant increased with increasing cobalt doping in  MnFe2O4 MNPs, which resulted in reduced interparticle interactions,  thereby prohibiting the collective magnetic behaviour in MNP systems  with higher anisotropy energy barrier [9]. Generally, such reduction in  interparticle interactions for high anisotropy cobalt ferrite MNPs is  beneficial for AC induction heating efficiency, as discussed  subsequently. In recent times, multi-core magnetic nano-clusters have gained a lot  of attraction for MFH applications [22]. The research interest is pri- marily driven by two aspects, viz., the possibility of loading  photo-thermal agents for light-to-heat conversion [23,24] or anti-cancer  drugs [25] within the comparatively larger hydrodynamic volume for  achieving multi-modal therapy, and several unique magnetic properties  of such multi-core magnetic nano-clusters, viz., super-ferromagnetism,  super-spin glass and superparamagnetic behaviour over length scales  considerably larger than the classical superparamagnetic limits of the  single MNPs [26]. Earlier studies reported super spin-glass-like behav- iour with strong interparticle interactions in aggregates of MnFe2O4 and  Fe3O4 MNPs, where the spin dynamics were typically governed by the  critical slowing down model [27,28]. Augmentation of interparticle  interaction by powder compaction on solvothermally synthesized  superparamagnetic MnFe2O4 MNPs (size ~ 6.5 ± 1.5 nm) revealed an  increase in coercivity and anisotropy energy density [29], which exhibit  strong influences on the AC induction heating efficiency of the MNPs. Increased anisotropy constant and coercivity have been reported to  cause a sharp increase in the AC magnetic field induced heating effi- ciency in superparamagnetic Fe3O4 MNPs [30]. AC induction heating  studies on MnFe2-xAgxO4 (x = 0–0.6) superparamagnetic MNPs (size ~  4–7 nm) indicated an increase in the sensitivity of the heating efficiency  with the applied frequency for higher non-magnetic doping and reduced  interparticle interactions [31]. The effect of interparticle interactions on  the heating efficiency of MNPs is complex [30], and positive [32],  negative [33], or non-monotonic [34] variations in the heating effi- ciency have been reported for various types of soft and hard ferrite  MNPs,  depending  on  the  actual  system  configuration  and  magneto-structural properties [35–37]. Several studies have reported  excellent MFH properties of iron oxide nano-clusters of varying sizes and  shapes [38,39]. Superior MFH properties of manganese ferrite  nano-clusters [23], hard/soft bi-magnetic MnFe2O4 and CoFe2O4  nano-clusters [40], and Co–Mn–Zn ferrite nano-clusters [41] have been  reported earlier. A typical cluster size of ~100 nm is preferred for MFH  applications, as it results in enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) in  the cancerous tissues [42,43]. Preparation of colloidally stable  multi-core nano-clusters often requires complex wet chemical proced- ures, and hence, as an alternative, colloidally stable nano-aggregates  (hydrodynamic size ~ 90 nm) of bio-compatible ferrimagnetic cobalt  ferrite MNPs are prepared in the present study for probing their AC in- duction heating properties. This is the primary objective of this study. With this objective, the magneto-calorimetric analyses of colloidally  stable nano-aggregates of ferrimagnetic cobalt ferrite MNPs with com- bined relaxation and hysteresis-mediated magneto-thermal energy  conversion are reported in the present study. Surface functionalization  of the prepared MNPs, using inorganic or organic moieties, is one of the  most widely used techniques for controlling the stability, size distribu- tion, magnetic properties, inter-particle interactions, and aggregation  [44]. Aslibeiki et al. probed the effect of tri-ethylene glycol coating on  the surfaces of solvothermally prepared MnFe2O4 MNPs (size ~ 7.1–7.5  nm) [45] and CoFe2O4 MNPs (size ~ 8.5–8.7 nm) [3], prepared using a  co-precipitation method, where it was observed that the presence of  polymeric coating improved the magnetic properties by reducing sur- face spin disorder, aided in homogenous size distributions of the MNPs,  and significantly improved stability by reducing the interparticle in- teractions, all of which potentially influence the AC induction heating  efficiency of the surface functionalized MNPs [3]. Amongst various  types of organic polymers, significant bio-compatibility has been re- ported for hydrophilic chitosan-coated CoFe2O4 MNPs over a wide range  of concentrations [13,19]. Hence, in the present study, chitosan is  selected for surface functionalization of the MNPs, which improved the  colloidal stability, resulted in a narrower hydrodynamic size distribu- tion, reduced the interparticle interactions, and improved the  bio-compatibility of the prepared MNPs. Detailed characterization of the  synthesized MNPs is carried out, and the relevant magneto-structural  data are utilized for analyzing the AC induction heating efficiency of  the synthesized MNPs. The bio-compatibility of the chitosan coated  MNPs is confirmed using in vitro cytotoxicity studies. 2. Materials and methods  2.1. Materials  Analytical grade Co(NO3)2.6H2O and Fe(NO3)3.9H2O salts, 25%  NH4OH solution, chitosan polymer, and acetic acid were obtained from  M/s Merck India. The chemicals were used in as-received conditions. The samples were prepared using deionized water. 2.2. Synthesis of uncoated and chitosan-coated CoFe2O4 MNPs  The co-precipitation method was used to prepare the cobalt ferrite  (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles. By dissolving the iron and cobalt salts in a  stoichiometric ratio of 2:1, an aqueous solution (100 mL) was prepared. The pH of the solution was then changed to ~7 by mixing ~25% NH4OH  aqueous solution while stirring continuously at 80 ◦C. After a digestion  period of ~5 h at ~80 ◦C, the solution was cooled to room temperature. After cooling, the black powder sample was vacuum filtered, washed  several times with deionized water, and dried at ~100 ◦C. The collected  samples were then annealed at ~550 ◦C for ~30 min to produce  CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (sample code: CP). The uncoated CoFe2O4  nanoparticles were added to the chitosan solution, prepared by the  addition of ~1 g chitosan in ~2% acetic acid. Thereafter 25% NH4OH  solution was slowly added to the mixture, and the resultant suspension  was ultrasonicated for ~2 h at ~80 ◦C. After sonication, the chitosan  coated CoFe2O4 MNPs (sample code: CP-CHN) were vacuum filtered,  washed several times with deionized water, and dried overnight. The  I. Anila et al. Ceramics International 49 (2023) 15183–15199 15185 synthesis steps are schematically shown in Fig. 1. 2.3. Physicochemical characterization, AC induction heating, and in vitro  cytotoxicity experiments  Powder X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, atomic force, and  transmission electron microscopy techniques were utilized to charac- terize the uncoated (CP) and chitosan-coated (CP–CHN) MNPs. On the  other hand, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron  (XPS) spectroscopy techniques were used to probe the presence of chi- tosan coating on the surface of the MNPs. Vibrating sample magne- tometry and M¨ossbauer spectroscopy studies were performed to  measure the magnetic properties of the prepared MNPs. Table S1 in the  supplementary information (SI), describes the characterization tech- niques along with the relevant experimental parameters. A commercial  induction heating system was utilized to perform the AC induction  heating studies at a frequency of ~126 kHz and AMF amplitudes varying  from 22.2 to 33.1 kA/m. A detailed description of the experimental  protocol is provided in Section S1 in the SI. Section S2 in the SI, describes  the experimental steps followed for in vitro cytotoxicity studies on the  L929 cell lines using the standard colorimetric MTT assay. 3. Results and discussions  3.1. Structural and morphological characterization  The crystalline structures of the uncoated (CP) and chitosan coated  (CP–CHN) MNPs were probed using XRD and Fig. 2a–b depicts the  corresponding refined XRD patterns for the CP and CP-CHN MNPs,  respectively. The diffraction peaks corresponding to the (444), (533),  (620), (440), (511), (422), (400), (222), (311), and (220) planes were  clearly discernible, which confirmed the cubic spinel structure (JCPDS  No. #22–1086) for the CP and CP-CHN MNPs [46]. The XRD peaks of  the MNPs coated with chitosan were found to be identical to those of the  uncoated MNPs, demonstrating that the surface modification had no  impact on the crystal structure. This observation was in agreement with  the earlier results reported by Lotfi et al. [47], where no visible differ- ences were discernible between the XRD patterns of the uncoated and  tri-ethylene  glycol-coated  Fe3O4  MNPs,  prepared  using  a  co-precipitation method, followed by polymer coating through solution  exchange route. Additionally, it was observed that neither sample’s  recorded XRD patterns contained any impurity peaks (within the  detection limit of XRD), demonstrating the phase purity of the synthe- sized MNPs. The broad XRD peaks of both samples indicated that the  synthesized MNPs were in the nano regime, which was subsequently  confirmed from the TEM images. The average crystallite sizes of the  Fig. 1.

Variations of sin2 θ with (h2 +k2 +l2) for the (c) CP and (d) CP-CHN MNPs. I. Anila et al. Ceramics International 49 (2023) 15183–15199 15186 MNPs were determined using the Scherrer’s formula: dhkl = 0.9λ β cos θ,  where λ, β, and θ indicate the X-ray wavelength, full width at half  maxima, and the Bragg angle, respectively. The average crystallite sizes  were estimated as ~12.9 ± 0.9 nm and ~13.2 ± 1.0 nm for the CP and  CP-CHN MNPs, respectively. Using the Rietveld analysis, the lattice parameters (a) were obtained as  ~ 8.387 ± 0.003 Å and ~8.384 ± 0.005 Å for the CP and CP-CHN MNPs,  respectively. For a cubic crystal system, sin2 θ = λ2 4a2 (h2 +k2 +l2) [7], and  Fig. 2c–d shows the linear variations of sin2 θ as a function of (h2 +k2 +l2) for the CP and CP-CHN MNPs, respectively. The estimated lattice param- eters were ~8.382 ± 0.004 Å and ~8.380 ± 0.007 Å for the CP and  CP-CHN MNPs, respectively, which were similar to the values obtained  from the Rietveld refinement, and agreed with the reported value of  ~8.391  Å  for  CoFe2O4  MNPs  (JCPDS:022–1086)  [46]. The X-ray density (ρx) of the samples was calculated using the formula:  ρX = 8MW Na3 , where MW and N are the molecular weight and the Avogadro’s  number, respectively. The predicted X-ray densities for the CP and CP-CHN  MNPs were 5.28 g/cc and 5.29 g/cc, respectively. Table 1 provides an  overview of the structural properties derived from the XRD data. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was utilized to analyze the  morphological characteristics and particle sizes of the MNPs, and  Fig. 3a–b shows the TEM images for the CP and CP-CHN MNPs,  respectively. The TEM images indicated a spherical morphology for the  CP and CP-CHN MNPs, with particle sizes varying between ~10 and 16  nm. The inset of Fig. 3b shows a high-resolution TEM image of the CP-  CHN MNPs, where the lattice fringes were clearly discernible for the  crystalline core, and the presence of the polymeric coating on the surface  of the MNPs was observable from the contrast variation. The particle  size distribution histograms are depicted in Fig. 3c–d for the CP and CP-  CHN MNPs, respectively. The experimental data were fitted with a log-  normal distribution of the form: f(d) = 1̅̅ 2 √ πσd exp ⎡ ⎢⎣ − [ ln ( d/d0 )]2 2σ2 ⎤ ⎥⎦, where d0  and σ are the fit parameters [3,29]. The log-normal fits are shown in  Fig. 3c–d, along with the values of d0 and σ for the CP and CP-CHN  MNPs, respectively. The average particle size (<d>) and the standard  deviation (σd) were estimated using the mathematical expressions: 〈d〉 = d0 exp [ σ2 2 ] and σd = 〈d〉[exp(σ2) − 1]1/2 [3,29]. The estimated average  particle sizes were ~13.1 ± 1.4 nm and ~13.3 ± 1.9 nm for the CP and  CP-CHN MNPs, respectively, which agreed with the average crystallite  sizes obtained from the XRD patterns. Isolated aggregation was also  visible from the TEM images (Fig. 3a–b), which was attributed to the  magnetic dipolar interaction between the MNPs, as well as their large  surface area and high surface energy, which augmented the aggregation  tendency [48]. However, the degree of aggregation was comparatively  lower for the CP-CHN MNPs, as the non-magnetic chitosan coating  reduced the strength of the dipolar interactions [49]. The selected area  electron diffraction (SAED) patterns for the CP and CP-CHN MNPs, are  shown in Fig. 3e–f, respectively, where well-resolved rings were  observed. The SAED patterns corresponding to the crystal planes (220),  (331), (400), (511), and (440) were indexed for both samples.

Radiotherapy and  Chemotherapy are widely adopted techniques for treating cancer but cause damage to the nearby healthy tissue. This paves the way for hyperthermia treatment for cancer. Since healthy cells are more heat-tolerant than  malignant cells, magnetic nanoparticles with superparamagnetic properties were used in hyperthermia treat- ment. Surface modified magnetite (Fe3O4) iron oxide nanoparticles with enhanced stability, solubility, bio-  compatibility and magnetic property were employed in hyperthermia treatment. In the present study, Super- paramagnetic Samarium doped magnetite (Fe3O4:Sm) nanoparticles were functionalized with Oleylamine (OAm)  and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) by the sol-gel process. The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray  powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Transmission Electron Microscopy  (TEM), and UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and  Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM). From XRD data, the crystallite size of oleylamine coated samarium  doped magnetite (OAm–Fe3O4:Sm) and PVA-coated samarium doped Fe3O4 (PVA- Fe3O4:Sm) were found to be  9.5 nm and 10.9 nm, respectively. TEM images of the functionalized nanoparticles were visualized as a spherical  structure with reduced agglomeration. UV-DRS gives the bandgap value of OAm–Fe3O4:Sm and PVA- Fe3O4:Sm  coated samarium doped magnetite to be 2.3 eV and 2 eV respectively. ","Results and discussion  3.1. X-ray diffraction (XRD)  XRD pattern of Fe3O4:Sm, OAm-Fe3O4:Sm and PVA- Fe3O4:Sm in  Fig. 1(a and b) shows single-phase magnetite nanoparticles having a  cubic inverse spinel structure. All the peaks in the XRD pattern can be  indexed with miller indices of (220), (311), (400), (511), (440) and  agree well with the reference peaks of magnetite (PDF #19–0629) and  no other secondary phase were predicted. The diffraction pattern of  oleylamine and PVA-coated samarium doped magnetite shows that the  crystalline structure was retained even after coating. It is observed that  the peak intensity decreases and peak width increase when compared  with Fe3O4:Sm, which may be due to the effect of OAm and PVA coating  on samarium-doped magnetite. The average crystallite size was calculated using Debye-Scherer’s  formula  Dhkl = 0.9λ βcosθ (1)   where β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM), the wavelength λ = 0.154056 nm and θ is the half diffraction angle of 2θ. The lattice  parameter was determined by Bragg’s law,  Fig. 1. XRD pattern of OAm–Fe3O4:Sm and PVA- Fe3O4:Sm. Fig. 2. (a,b): FTIR spectrum for OAm–Fe3O4:Sm and PVA- Fe3O4:Sm. K. Hemalatha et al.

The average crystallite size of OAm–Fe3O4:Sm  nanoparticles was found to be 9.5 nm and lattice parameter a = 8.37 Å. The average crystallite size of PVA- Fe3O4:Sm nanoparticles was found  to be 10.9 nm and lattice parameter a = 8.36 Å. As the PVA and OAm  coating increases the crystallite size and decreases the lattice parameter  of samarium doped magnetite, it manifests that the surface of nano- particles was successfully coated with PVA and OAm. 3.2. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy  Fig. 2(a) shows the IR spectrum of OAm–Fe3O4:Sm measured using  FTIR. The peak observed at 1560 cm−1 is attributed to the NH2 group. The peak observed at 2921 cm−1 and 2853 cm−1 are asymmetric (Vas)  and symmetric (Vs) stretching vibrations of methylene groups (CH2),  respectively. The peak at 451 and 650 cm−1 corresponds to Fe–O and  Sm–O, respectively. Fig. 2(b) shows the FTIR of PVA- Fe3O4:Sm. As mentioned in Fig. 2  (a), the peaks at 451 cm−1 and 653 cm−1 corresponds to the functional  group of Fe–O and Sm–O respectively. The peaks at 1373 cm−1 and  1587 cm−1 are functional groups (CH and OH) [29]. C= O functional  group is observed at the peak of 1732 cm−1. The peak at 2910-2940  cm−1 belongs to the CH2 functional group. 3.3. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  Fig. 3(a and b) shows the TEM image of OAm–Fe3O4:Sm nano- particles with different magnifications. The particle size was narrow and  found to be 9.8 nm which was closer to the value of the XRD pattern (9.5  nm). In Fe3O4:Sm the particles tend to agglomerate, whereas in oleyl- amine coated NPs the agglomeration gets reduced. Fig. 3(c), shows the  SAED pattern and value of interplanar distance ‘d’. Diffraction rings  correspond to (440), (400) and (511) planes with interplanar distances  d of 1.5 Å, 2.1 Å, 1.6 Å could be identified from the figure. As shown in  the supplementary figure [Fig. S1(b)], the inverse FFT and clear lattice  fringes were displayed and d spacing values were calculated. For OAm-  Fe3O4:Sm, the value of d is 2.54 Å and it corresponds to the (311) plane  of cubic structure magnetite. Supplementary figure [Fig. S1(b)], con- firms the good crystalline quality of the synthesized nanoparticles as  there is no discontinuity in the fringes. But supplementary figure [Fig. S1  (c)], shows the fringes at the boundary were disrupted, which may be  due to the coating of OAm on the shell. Fig. 3. (a,b,c): TEM and SAED image of OAm–Fe3O4:Sm. K. Hemalatha et al. Ceramics International 48 (2022) 24485–24495 24489 TEM image of PVA- Fe3O4:Sm is shown in Fig. 4 (a,b). From the  figure, it is evident that the PVA coating reduced the agglomeration of  the particles. The particle size was found to be 10.7 nm, which was  closer to the size calculated from XRD data (10.9 nm). Fig. 4 (c) shows  the selected area diffraction (SAED) pattern. The diffraction rings  correlate to (220),(400) and (422) planes with a d spacing of 2.8 Å, 2.1  Å, 1.7 Å. Supplementary figure [Fig. S2(b)], shows the crystalline nature  of the NPs employing inverse FFT, lattice fringes were continuous and  d spacing values were calculated. From inverse FFT inter-planar spacing  of PVA- Fe3O4:Sm, the value is 3.02 Å, which corresponds to the (220)  plane of cubic structure magnetite. Supplementary figure [Fig. S2(c)]  shows the fringes at the boundary, and the fringes were interrupted due  to the presence of PVA on the surface. 3.4. UV-DRS spectroscopy  Fig. 5 shows (αhν)2 versus (hν eV) of OAm-Fe3O4:Sm and PVA-  Fe3O4:Sm respectively. The band-gap energies were calculated using the  Tauc plot based on the diffuse reflectance spectra. From Fig. 5, the band-  gap energy (Eg) of OAm–Fe3O4:Sm and PVA- Fe3O4:Sm was determined  Fig. 4. (a,b,c): TEM and SAED image of PVA- Fe3O4:Sm. Fig. 5. UV-DRS, optical bandgap value of OAm–Fe3O4:Sm and PVA- Fe3O4:Sm. K. Hemalatha et al. Ceramics International 48 (2022) 24485–24495 24490 to be 2.3 eV and 2 eV respectively. The bandgap value of Fe2Sm1O4 was  found to be 2.7 eV, which was reported earlier30. From UV-DRS it was  found that the band-gap value of OAm–Fe3O4:Sm and PVA- Fe3O4:Sm  decreases when compared to the band-gap value of Fe3O4:Sm. The en- ergy band-gap of the nanomaterials is inversely proportional to their  size. The decrease in band-gap value here can be attributed to increasing  in crystallite size observed in XRD analysis. Fe3O4 is an n-type and p-  type semiconductor with a band-gap in the range of 0.1–3 eV, so  OAm–Fe3O4:Sm and PVA- Fe3O4:Sm were in the structure of Fe3O4 NPs. 3.5. Thermogravimetric analysis  Fig. 6(a and b), shows the TGA plot of OAm–Fe3O4:Sm and PVA-  Fe3O4:Sm. The percentage of weight loss as a function of the tempera- ture of OAm–Fe3O4:Sm shows the sample was stable till 250 ◦C without  any weight loss. The weight loss of 1.08% from 250◦ – 515 ◦C was due to  the decomposition of oleylamine on the surface of Fe3O4:Sm. The TGA  plot of PVA- Fe3O4:Sm shows the sample was stable and had no weight  loss till 230 ◦C. The weight loss of 2.81% from 230◦ - 515 ◦C was  attributed to dehydration of the –OH group in PVA. The weight loss  indicates that the Fe3O4:Sm was coated with OAm and PVA, and also  shows the stability of the sample. 3.6. Magnetic property  At room temperature magnetic response of the sample was evaluated  by M (Vs) H curve using a vibrating sample magnetometer. Fig. 7 shows  the MH curve of OAm–Fe3O4:Sm and PVA- Fe3O4:Sm nanoparticles  respectively. It reveals no hysteresis loop and both the samples show  superparamagnetic behaviour. The maximum value of magnetic saturation (Ms) for Fe3O4:Sm [30]  was 66.43 (emu/g) and for OAm-Fe3O4:Sm was found to be 35.38  (emu/g). Magnetic saturation for PVA-Fe3O4:Sm was found to be 27.27  (emu/g). The decrease in Ms may be due to OAm and PVA coating. It has  been reported that the presence of non-magnetic layers on the MNPs  surface was the factor in the decrease in magnetic saturation [31]. OAm-Fe3O4:Sm shows a high Ms value when compared to PVA-Fe3O4:  Sm. The decrease in the Ms value of PVA-Fe3O4:Sm may be due to the  high concentration of PVA and the presence of the –OH group in PVA  [32–36]. We have calculated effective anisotropy using the law of  approach to saturation (LAS).

One of the primary hindrances for rapid adaptation of  this technique is the loss of heating efficiency when the MNPs are placed within the viscous tissue medium,  which necessitates undesired increase in MNP concentrations or exposure time during practical applications. With an objective to mitigate this, here we report the viscosity independent magnetic hyperthermia properties of  biocompatible ultrafine (average size ~ 2.5 nm) chitosan-coated superparamagnetic CoFe2O4 MNPs synthesized  using a low-cost co-precipitation technique. The presence of the chitosan coating is confirmed from Fourier  transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The superparamagnetic nature of the synthesized  MNPs at 300 K is confirmed from M¨ossbauer spectroscopy, isothermal and temperature dependent magnetization  studies. Experimental findings indicate a higher field-induced heating efficiency for the chitosan-coated MNPs  due to superior colloidal stability.

Introduction  Spinel ferrites nanoparticles have enormous potential in a variety of  industrial and bio-medical applications due to their unique magneto-  structural properties [1–3], where the ability of manipulating these  nanoparticles using an external magnetic field is exploited for techno- logical benefits.

In MFH, MNP dispersions, known as magnetic nanofluids  or ferrofluids, are localized within tumours and subjected to an alter- nating  magnetic  field  (AMF). Inherent  relaxation  mediated  magneto-thermal energy conversion is utilized for cancer therapy,  where a temperature rise beyond 42 ◦C is found to be favourable for  imparting thermal damage to the cancerous tissues, without significant  damage to the surrounding healthy tissues [2,14–16]. MFH has exhibi- ted significant response towards various types of cancers, like pancreas  tumours, glioblastoma and prostate cancer [2,17]. In comparison to the  traditional cancer therapies, like radiotherapy or chemotherapy, the  primary benefits of MFH are the possibility of localized heating of the  cancer tissues, by exploiting MNPs coated with tumour homing moieties  and distal magnetic field induced guidance of the MNPs towards tumour  specific sites [2,18]. In MFH, apart from the external field parameters,  the heating efficiency significantly varies with size, polydispersity,  morphology, anisotropy energy, coercivity, saturation magnetization,  susceptibility of the MNPs, medium viscosity and MNP concentrations  [14,19–21]. As a result, an excellent control over these properties is vital  for optimizing the MFH efficiency. Ease of synthesis, well accepted  chemistry for production of size and shape tunable MNPs, superior  magnetization values and good bio-compatibility have made iron oxide  (γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) nanoparticles as the most widely used MNPs in  MFH. However, several other types of mixed ferrite MNPs, like Cu, Mn,  Co and Ni-doped ferrite MNPs have been exploited for MFH [2,22,23]. Among these, cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) MNPs have attracted consider- able research interest due to high saturation magnetization and  magneto-crystalline anisotropy and good chemical stability [24,25]. Superparamagnetic CoFe2O4 MNPs, with zero or negligible room tem- perature coercivity and remanence have found applications in MFH [26,  27], drug carriers [6,26] and various industrial applications [28]. One of the primary hindrances towards adaptation of MFH-based  cancer therapy is the decrease in heating efficiency, after injection of  the MNPs in the cancerous tissues. When placed within high viscosity  tissue medium, abrogation of Brownian relaxation occurs due to the  immobilization of the MNPs, which reduces the Brownian relaxation  mediated magneto-thermal energy conversion [14,29]. On increasing  the viscosity of the dispersion medium, earlier studies reported  ~96–97% and ~26–87% decrease in heating efficiency for cobalt ferrite  [30,31] and iron oxide [30,32,33] MNPs, respectively. Such loss of AMF  induced heating efficiency is undesirable for practical applications and  hence, studies are being conducted to enhance the heating efficiency of  MNPs by oriented aggregation using a static magnetic field [34,35], in  addition to the AMF, or by optimizing the magneto-structural properties  of the MNPs [2,36,37]. Further, in most of the experimental studies,  MFH efficiencies are reported in aqueous medium, where the viscosity is  vastly different from the actual tissue media. This calls for further in- vestigations on optimizing the MFH efficiency of MNPs located within  viscous media. With this objective, in the present study, ultrafine  superparamagnetic CoFe2O4 MNPs were synthesized to probe the vis- cosity independent AMF induced heating properties, as the relaxation  dynamics for such ultrafine CoFe2O4 MNPs is primary N´eel dominated,  where the relaxation time is independent of medium viscosity [14]. Additionally, for bio-medical applications, the CoFe2O4 MNPs need  to be coated with suitable moieties to render colloidal stability in  physiological pH, hydrophilicity and bio-compatibility [24]. Various  types of natural agents [6] or organic moieties, like dextran, poly- ethylene glycol, folic acid, peptides, chitosan, starch and other glucose  derivatives are the most widely used coating agents for preparing  bio-compatible MNPs [2,24]. Among these, chitosan has attracted wide  popularity due to its demonstrated superior bio-compatibility, low  non-specific toxicity, biodegradability, bio-adhesion, film forming and  gelation ability [38,39]. Additional advantage of chitosan coating is the  availability of the amine groups for further bio-conjugation. Hence, in  the present study, the MNPs were coated with chitosan polymer to  enhance the bio-compatibility and suitability for practical applications. The magneto-structural and surface properties of the chitosan-coated  MNPs were studied in detail, which was essential to understand the  AMF induced heating efficiency. The AMF induced heating properties  were probed for the MNPs dispersed in aqueous as well as  tissue-equivalent agar media. The variations in heating efficiency were  estimated experimentally and using dynamic hysteresis loop-based cal- culations. The obtained results are beneficial for designing efficient  magnetic nanofluids for practical MFH applications. 2. Experimental  2.1. Materials  Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O and Fe(NO3)3⋅9H2O salts along with 25% NH4OH  solutions were purchased from M/s Merck India Ltd. All chemicals were  of analytical grade, and were used without any further purification. Agar, used for the MFH studies, was obtained from M/s Sigma Aldrich. 2.2. Synthesis of CoFe2O4 MNPs  CoFe2O4 MNPs were synthesized by a chemical co-precipitation  method. An aqueous solution of ferric and cobalt nitrates in a molar  ratio of 2:1 was prepared by dissolving ferric and cobalt metal nitrates in  100 mL deionized water. Then the pH of the metal nitrate (2Fe:1Co)  solution was maintained to ~ 7 [40], by adding 25% NH4OH solution  under constant stirring at 80 ◦C. To obtain ultrafine CoFe2O4 MNPs, the  stirring speed was optimized to 1750 rpm [41]. The solution was then  continuously stirred for 5 h at 80 ◦C, followed by natural cooling. The  resulting black precipitates were washed several times using deionized  water, and dried overnight. The collected samples are hereafter indi- cated as SO. 2.3. Chitosan coating of CoFe2O4 MNPs  The synthesized superparamagnetic CoFe2O4 MNPs of 1 g (section  2.2) were dispersed in deionized water by ultrasonication. Then 1%  chitosan solution (obtained by adding 0.2 g of chitosan to a mixture of  deionized water and acetic acid) was added to the aforesaid dispersion. The resultant mixture was ultrasonicated for 120 min at 80 ◦C. After  ultrasonication, the chitosan-coated superparamagnetic CoFe2O4 MNPs  were separated from the colloidal suspension by vacuum filtering. This  was followed by through water washing and overnight drying. The  chitosan-coated CoFe2O4 MNPs are hereafter indicated as SC. Fig. 1  schematically shows the steps involved in the preparation of SO and SC  MNPs. 2.4. Magneto-structural characterization, MFH and in vitro cytotoxicity  studies  Magneto-structural characterizations of the prepared MNPs were  carried out using room temperature powder X-ray diffraction (XRD),  Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron  microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample  magnetometer (VSM) and M¨ossbauer spectrometry. Detailed description  of the characterization techniques is available in Section S1, in the  supplementary information. MFH studies were performed at varying field amplitudes of  33.1–22.2 kA/m and a fixed frequency of ~126 kHz. For MFH studies,  the MNP concentration was kept constant at ~5 wt %. For MFH studies  on the agar-based systems, the MNP concentration was unchanged,  whereas the agar concentration was fixed at ~2 wt % to simulate soft  tissue equivalent conditions [42]. Temperature measurements were  performed using a fiber optic sensor and an infrared camera [43]. The  surrounding temperature was kept constant at ~30 ± 2 ◦C throughout  the experiments. Deatiled description of the MFH experiments is  I. Anila et al. Ceramics International 48 (2022) 22767–22781 22769 provided in Section S2, in the supplementary information. In vitro cytotoxicity investigations were carried out on mouse fibro- blast L929 cell line, using the conventional MTT-assay protocol [6]. Detailed description of the experimental method is provided in Section  S3, in the supplementary information. 3. Results and discussion  3.1. Structural properties of the MNPs  Fig. 2a shows the room temperature XRD patterns of the SO and SC  MNPs, along with the refined patterns. The characteristic diffraction  peaks, corresponding to the (533), (440), (511), (422), (400), (222),  (311) and (220) planes of the cubic spinel structure (Fd3m) are indexed  (JCPDS file No 22-1086) [44]. No impurity peaks were detected within  the resolution range of XRD. The characteristic peaks of CoFe2O4 MNPs  did not disappear or change for the chitosan-coated CoFe2O4 nano- particles, indicating that the cubic spinel structure was retained for the  chitosan-coated CoFe2O4 MNPs (SC). The broad XRD peaks of the SO  and SC samples confirmed that the synthesized samples were of  ultra-fine dimensions. Rietveld refinement indicated lattice parameters of ~8.379 ± 0.005  Å and ~8.381 ± 0.004 Å for the SO and SC MNPs, respectively. Fig. 2b  and c show the linear variations of sin2θ with (h2+k2+l2) for the SO and  SC MNPs, respectively (for cubic systems, sin 2 θ = λ2 4a2 (h2 + k2 + l2),  where a is the lattice parameter [45]). The estimated lattice parameters  were ~8.374 ± 0.007 Å and ~8.389 ± 0.006 Å for the SO and SC MNPs,  respectively, which were similar to the values obtained from the Riet- veld analysis. Similar lattice parameters in both cases indicated that the  chitosan coating did not influence the crystal structure of the CoFe2O4  MNPs. The average crystallite sizes, obtained from the Scherrer’s  Fig. 1. Schematic illustration showing the preparation of the uncoated (SO) and chitosan-coated (SC) CoFe2O4 MNPs. Fig. 2.

Investigators have taken an extraordinary consideration and synthesis of  spinel ferrite nanoparticles due to their extensive applications across different fields such as biomedical and  industrial fields as compared to bulk counterparts. The present review focuses on the role of nanoparticle size  (<100 nm) in different biomedical applications, the reason for such size effect, and the best size necessity for the  greatest performance in various biomedical applications, mainly on the spinel ferrite nanoparticle’s induction  heating (magnetic hyperthermia), photocatalysis, and cytotoxicity properties. In this magnetic hyperthermia,  photocatalytic and cytotoxicity study, new chances will be elevated to address the tasks capably and efficiently  using modified spinel ferrites. Spinel ferrite nanoparticles are less price magnetic materials and are stable under  various circumstances. This review purposes to contribute to the applications of various spinel ferrite nano- particles in medicine and the environment and their broader research chances across various disciplines. Moreover, the possible retrieval and recycling of ferrite nanoparticles’ existence as a catalyst in wastewater  treatment are addressed. Overall, this review huts light on the present position of spinel ferrite nanoparticles  concerning their biocompatibility properties. In the survey of the literature, fewer articles are existing on the  cytotoxicity study of the spinel ferrite nanoparticles. 1. ","The results revealed  that ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles show >80% cell viability at 0.01 μg/L  concentration [98]. Fig. 5a exhibits control cells (LNCap) after 24 h of  incubation, there is no dead cells were observed. Fig. 5b and c depict the  influence of gamma irradiation on the cancer cells (in the absence) and  nanoparticles (in the presence). In the presence of nanoparticles  observed that the more destructed cancer cells were compared to those  in the absence of nanoparticles. Influence of radiotherapy cases cells was  no perfect shape and wrinkled. Higher cell demolition obtained in the  radiotherapy using the nanoparticles can be allotted to the cytotoxicity  of the ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles against the cells (LNCaP), particularly  under gamma irradiation. Fig. 5d shows the cell viability of ZnFe2O4  nanoparticles and ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles with gamma irradiation on  LNCaP cells at 0–100 μg/mL concentration. The ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles  depict >90% cell viability compared to ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles with  gamma irradiation at 0–100 μg/mL concentration. Several people have been reported ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles with  different reagents but they used diverse applications, for example, the  author M. Elain Hajlaoui et al., have been reported ZnFe2O4 nano- particles prepared by solid-state reaction method and they reported the  high dielectric constant of synthesized ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles could be  useful for supercapacitor application [100], Yassine Mouhib et al.,  investigated the co-precipitation synthesis of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles  from Moroccan non-standard reagents and studied their magnetic  properties only, but the biocompatibility behavior was not determined  [101]. The ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles have been exposed to be significantly  versatile in several applications, as per the related published literature  survey gives some drawbacks on ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles applications  such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and individual care products. Hence, there is essential for additional research in the above-mentioned  areas. Fig. 3.

MgFe2O4 nanoparticles  The MgFe2O4, being a significant member of the spinel ferrite family,  exhibits special properties such as cytotoxic effect and less eddy current  losses, etc. The soft magnetic material behavior of MgFe2O4, which finds  a sum of applications in sensor and heterogeneous catalysis etc., and its  magnetic property owing to the d5 electronic significant-spin configu- ration of the iron middles [102]. Low magnetocrystalline anisotropy of  MgFe2O4 nanoparticles exhibits superparamagnetic behavior which is  useful for magnetic hyperthermia treatment of cancer [103]. Magneti- zation arises in MgFe2O4 from the antiparallel arrangement of ferric ions  at TA and TB sites respectively; hence the magnetic properties of the  MgFe2O4 depend on the distribution of cations, which intern depends on  the technique of preparation and processing situations [104]. MgFe2O4  has a significant photocatalyst for water refinement because of its own  required properties such as photo corrosion resistance and photo- absorption [105]. The MgFe2O4 has been confirmed to have exciting  photoelectrochemical (water splitting) and photocatalytic properties  [106]. Fig. 6a shows MgFe2O4 nanoparticles dye degradation in the  presence of methylene blue under visible light irradiation. An observed  peak at 663 nm is related to methylene blue. As can be seen in the figure,  the peak intensity drastically reduces without any additional peak, this  is confirmed that the photocatalyst decomposition (in the presence of  methylene blue) under visible light irradiation. Fig. 6b shows the pho- toelectrochemical water splitting activity of the MgFe2O4 catalyst in a 1  M NaOH aqueous solution. Compared to the dark state the catalyst  photocurrent density has two times higher under sunlight, which in- dicates that, the photoexcitation activity among the valence band and  the conduction band. The author V. M. Khot et al. have been prepared  20 nm particle size of dextran-coated MgFe2O4 nanoparticles that were  synthesized by combustion method for magnetic fluid hyperthermia  applications. The prepared nanoparticles revealed a SAR value of 85.57  W/g at 265 kHz frequency and the prepared nanoparticles showed sig- nificant cell viability on mice fibroblast (L929) cells. The authors have  been reported that dextran-coated nanoparticles can be used as signifi- cant heating mediators in magnetic fluid hyperthermia [107]. The eco-friendly and n-type semiconducting behavior of MgFe2O4  nanoparticles exhibited the best photocatalytic activity owing to the  obtainable additional catalytic sites by their crystal lattices [109]. Fig. 7a shows MgFe2O4 nanoparticles TEM micrograph and it has  revealed a quasi-spherical shape and about average particle size of  10–40 nm. The SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 7a) confirms the good crys- tallinity. Fig. 7b shows the magnetic hyperthermia profile of MgFe2O4  nanoparticles at 5 mg/mL ferrofluid concentration.

The  SAR values were found to be nearly 35–220 W/g. The SAR improvement  may happen due to the magnetic hysteresis loss improvement caused by  dipole-dipole interactions. Microwave-assisted synthesis of MgFe2O4 nanoparticles exhibits  photocatalytic contaminant degradation in visible light [102] and the  other hand the microwave synthesis of MgFe2O4 nanoparticles at 600 ◦C  annealing temperature revealed the high generation of hydroxyl radicals  under visible light [111]. The MgFe2O4 nanoparticles have a ~2 eV  bandgap, so their magnetic nanoparticles could be significant photo- catalytic to eliminate the contamination [108].

Shunmuga Priya et al., have been reported that lemon juice-  assisted combustion synthesis of MgFe2O4 nanoparticles shows elec- trical humidity sensor behavior, but they did not perform biocompati- bility behavior of MgFe2O4 [113]. Liu Wenfeng et al. investigated  sesame straw-like MgFe2O4/N-doped hollow porous carbon nanofiber  composite was prepared by electrostatic spinning, they reported only  physicochemical properties but they did not perform any cytotoxic study  activities [114]. In maximum cases, MgFe2O4 nanoparticles synthesis methods are  selected and established on their qualities and faults. However, there are  still quite numerous parameters that need to be completely studied  thoroughly. Furthermore, the manufacture of MgFe2O4 nanoparticles  used in industrial wastes and the biomedical field is under study still, but  these types have the importance of being eco-friendly. 4. MnFe2O4 nanoparticles  The MnFe2O4 nanoparticles belong to the spinel ferrite group; have  established wide courtesy to science and technology owing to their  outstanding electrical and magnetic and biomedical properties etc. [116].

Introduction  In recent years composite nanomaterials have attracted great interest  to the scientific community due to the combined physicochemical  properties of their individual parts. The nanocomposites are advanced  materials composed of two or more materials (at least one of the ma- terials has one dimension in the nanometer range) and show some new  and advanced characteristics as compared to the component materials  * Corresponding author.

These composite nanoparticles are of great importance in different  areas of science and technology such as optics, electronics, environment,  aerospace, medical field, etc. [2,3]. The diverse applications of com- posite nanoparticles are subjected to their structure, composition, sta- bility, etc. [4]. Nanocomposite materials formed by metal and magnetic  nanoparticles give rise to interesting optical and magnetic properties  [5]. Combining the magnetic and optical properties, have a major  advantage to use the nanocomposites for biomedical applications in  disease diagnosis and therapeutic with better efficiency than individual  constituents [6,7]. Among all the metallic nanoparticles, gold and iron oxide, have been  found very useful for biomedical applications. The chemical stability  against oxygen (least reactive than other metals), biocompatibility, bio-  inertness, and strong optical properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)  make them suitable for biomedical applications [8]. Iron oxide nano- particles  (IONPs),  due  to  their  biocompatibility,  inherent  multi-functionality, and magnetic properties, have also been used in  several biomedical applications, especially for magnetic resonance im- aging (MRI), drug delivery, and magnetic hyperthermia-therapeutic  applications (MHT), etc. [9,10]. The broad applicability of the mag- netic property of IONPs with the optical property of the AuNPs builds  the interest in developing iron oxide-gold nanocomposites (IO–Au NPs)  for medical applications. Several studies have been performed to obtain composite nano- materials via numerous synthesis approaches with controllable structure  and morphology for specific applications [11,12]. The conventional  chemical and physical methods involved in nanocomposite synthesis are  generally carried out at high temperatures, require multi-steps, involve  toxic chemical solvents, and generate substances as by-products [13]. The presence of toxic chemicals in trace amounts on the surface of  synthesized nanocomposites raises a biosafety concern which limits  their use for biomedical applications [14]. Thus, a rapid, novel approach  is needed to reduce the complexity, cost, and toxicity issues of existing  techniques to synthesize nanocomposites that can be appreciably used  for in-vitro and in-vivo biological and biomedical applications. An  environment-friendly, reproducible, green pathway to fabricate  biocompatible nanocomposites by using plants as naturally occurring  sources can overcome the above-mentioned issues of existing synthesis  techniques. The phytochemicals present in plants act as a reducing as  well as a capping agent for nanocomposite synthesis [15]. The present study reports the novel, cost-effective and green syn- thesis of biocompatible, superparamagnetic, and multifunctional iron  oxide-gold composite nanoparticles (IO–Au NPs) using aqueous leaf  extract of the medicinal plant, Pimenta dioica. The eugenol constituent  (approximately 90% of its leaves extract) of its leaves extract acts as a  natural reducing agent and also as a stabilizing agent in the green syn- thesis process [16]. The structural, optical, and morphological in- vestigations of green synthesized composite nanoparticles have been  done by using conventional techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD),  UV–visible absorption spectroscopy (UV–Vis), electron microscopy, and  Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The green synthesized  IO-Au NPs are found to be non-toxic and safe for cells as established  using the MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium  Bromide) assay. The magnetic properties of synthesized IO-Au NPs have been eval- uated by using a superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID)  magnetometer. The IO-Au NPs show superparamagnetic behavior, and  their efficacy as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  has been evaluated in an aqueous medium. The potential of the green  synthesized nanocomposites, as an exogenous MRI contrast agent is also  evaluated using chicken breast tissue and poultry heart. Moreover, the  synthesized IO-Au NPs showed absorbance in the wavelength range of  ~800–1100 nm, which is a tissue-transparent NIR region. In this region,  biological tissues show negligible absorbance or nearly transparency  and allow deep penetration of NIR light into tissue. To exploit the  therapeutic ability of these IO-Au NPs, we have checked their heating  performance under the application of an external oscillating magnetic  field. Also, the photothermal performance of these IO-Au NPs has been  examined in the NIR region using 1064 nm wavelength light. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the green  synthesis of biocompatible and multifunctional IO-Au NPs using Pimenta  dioica for their successful applications as contrast agents for magnetic  resonance imaging and magnetic as well as photothermal hyperthermia  therapeutic agent. The overall results suggest that in future, these green  synthesized IO-Au NPs can successfully replace the existing conven- tional theranostic agents. 2. Materials and methods  2.1. Chemicals  Iron chloride (II) tetrahydrate (FeCl2.4H2O, ≥99%), iron chloride  (III) hexahydrate (FeCl3.6H2O, ≥99%), hydrogen tetrachloroaurate tri- hydrate (HAuCl4⋅3H2O, ≥99%), ethanol, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3,  ≥99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and were used without  further purification. 2.2. Green synthesis of iron oxide-gold composite nanoparticles (IO–Au  NPs)  Leaves of the aromatic medicinal plant, Pimenta dioica were procured  from the botanical garden of Bareilly College at Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh,  India. Deionized water was used to wash the leaves and the washed  leaves of Pimenta dioica were cut and dried followed by crushing with a  mortar and pestle. 20 g of crushed leaves were soaked in 100 ml of  deionized water and allowed to heat for 10 min at 60–80 ◦C. The pre- pared aqueous extract was then filtered using Whatman filter paper No. 42. The filtered extract was stored at 4 ◦C for further use. For the synthesis of the composite nanoparticles, iron oxide nano- particles were synthesized as reported in our previous work [17]. Briefly, the FeCl2.4H2O and FeCl3.6H2O precursors were dissolved into a  molar ration of 1:2 in 100 ml of deionized water. The precursor solution  was allowed to heat at 70 ◦C for 10 min while stirring at 500 rpm using a  magnetic stirrer. Then the prepared extract of Pimenta dioica leaves was  added drop by drop into the precursor solution. The yellowish color  precursor solution was then turned reddish-brown, indicating the for- mation of nanoparticles. To obtain the iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)  in precipitate form, sodium bicarbonate (40 ml of 1 M) was added to  increase the pH of the solution and the color of the solution was changed  from reddish-brown to black. The precipitated IONPs were filtered and  washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove any surface  contamination. The washed precipitate was dried in a hot air oven and  crushed with mortar and pestle to get IONPs in powder form. After that, gold is reduced on the surface of the as-prepared iron  oxide nanoparticles with some modifications, as reported by Bell et al. and Haratifar et al. [18,19]. For the formation of iron oxide-gold com- posite nanoparticles, 0.1 g of the as-prepared iron oxide nanoparticles  were resuspended and mixed with a 50 ml aqueous solution of 1 mM  Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate trihydrate (HAuCl4⋅3H2O) under sonication  for 10 min. This brownish color dispersion of IONPs in HAuCl4⋅3H2O  was then vigorously stirred at 80 ◦C for 15 min. After that 10 ml of  Pimenta dioica, leaf extract was added drop by drop to reduce gold ions  (Au3+) from HAuCl4⋅3H2O solution, to obtain the gold nanoparticles on  the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles. The color of the solution changed  from brownish to reddish-brown due to the formation of gold nano- particles. The reaction was continued for 15 min and the formed iron  oxide-gold nanoparticles were washed thrice with deionized water and  ethanol in order to remove any unbound residue of extract and then  dried in a hot air oven.

Structural characterizations  The crystal structure and phase compositions of synthesized nano- composites were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using  Rigaku Smartlab automated multipurpose X-ray Diffractometer with  Cu–K radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). Measurement was performed in the  scan range of 2θ = 20–80◦ at a step of 2◦/min. The presence of functional groups in the plant extract as well as on  the surface of the synthesized IO-Au NPs was identified using Fourier  transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements performed on a  Tensor 27 Bruker spectrometer. The powdered leaf and IO-Au NPs were  mixed with potassium bromide (KBr) to form the pellet for measure- ment. The spectra were measured in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. 2.3.2. Morphological and elemental characterizations  The shape and average particle size of IO-Au NPs were measured by  electron microscopy techniques. The field emission scanning electron  microscope (Zeiss Supra55 FE-SEM) was used at 20 kV and the samples  were prepared on a carbon-coated aluminium stub (size approximately  8 × 8 mm), by adding a small amount of sample on it. The samples were  coated with a gold nanolayer by using a sputter coater (Quorum Q150R  ES) at an applied current of 50 mA for 120 s to get a better contrast in the  SEM images. The transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 F20) equipped  with a field emission gun operated at 200 kV was also utilized to mea- sure the size and shape of IO-Au NPs. Samples were prepared by  weighing approximately 0.01 g of synthesized nanoparticles dispersed  into 5 ml deionized water under sonication. 10 μl of this suspension was  dropped and dried on a carbon-coated copper grid (300 mesh) pur- chased from QUANTIFOIL. Size analysis from the transmission electron  micrographs was performed using image processing software ImageJ  version 1.53e, which is a public domain Java-based image processing  program developed at the National Institutes of Health, USA [20]. The presence of elements in the synthesized nanoparticles was  determined by an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) (Oxford  Instruments X-max, Aztec) on a field emission scanning electron mi- croscope (Zeiss Supra55 FE-SEM). 2.3.3. Optical characterization  The absorption spectrum from the powdered sample of IO-Au NPs  was recorded in the reflecting integrated sphere geometry using a  spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 25) in the wavelength range  of 450–1100 nm. 2.3.4. Magnetic measurements  The superconducting quantum interference device (Quantum  Design, USA) magnetometer was used to measure the magnetization of  the IO-Au NPs powder sample at an applied magnetic field of 80 Oe. Approximately 10 mg of sample was immersed in degassed oil to prevent  oxidation under nitrogen. The oil-covered nanocomposite sample was  placed in a gel capsule, packed with glass wool, and suspended in a  straw. Hysteresis measurements were performed at 300 K respectively. Hysteresis measurements were performed at 300 K.  2.4. In-vitro biosafety assessment of green synthesized IO-Au NPs  The cytotoxicity of the green synthesized IO-Au NPs was examined  by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bro- mide) assay. Human Cervical cancer (HeLa) cell lines were used for the  MTT assay. Cells were maintained in a state of continuous growth in  Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%  fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 ◦C in a humidified incubator containing  5% CO2. The media contains 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were  seeded in the 96-well plate with a seeded density of 104 cells per well  and incubated for 24 h at 37 ◦C for further experiment. After 24 h, the  media was removed and nanoparticles suspended at different concen- trations in fresh media were added to the cell-containing wells.

This technology has been used for a variety of applications such as thermoresponsive materials, catalytic chemistry, and drug delivery systems. In this study, we evaluate two distinct thermally labile Diels-Alder linkers for the release of payloads from the surface of magnetic iron oxide nano- particles. Density functional theory (DFT) computational predictions of the Gibbs free energy and enthalpy re- action barriers were performed and revealed a dramatic difference in reverse energy barriers between the two linkers. These thiophene-based cycloadducts were then synthesized, conjugated to the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles, and characterized by NMR and ESI-MS. The results of the modeling were conﬁrmed when the functionalized nanoparticles were subjected to immersion heating and the payload release rates observed were in agreement with the DFT calculations. Similarly, AMF-RF hysteretic heating of the functionalized nanoparticles revealed payload release rates that correlated with the DFT calculations and the data from the heat immersion studies. Together, these results indicate that these distinct thermally labile Diels-Alder linkers can be used to ﬁne- tune the kinetics of payload release from nanoparticles. 1.

Magnetic nanoparticles can be used to modulate Diels-Alder and retro Diels-Alder reactions through localized heating via Brownian motion and N�eel relaxation mechanisms when stimulated by an externally applied alternating mag- netic ﬁeld radiofrequency (AMF-RF) [16]. The heat generated by the magnetic nanoparticles promotes the Diels-Alder or retro Diels-Alder reaction on their surface. In a recently reported study, iron oxide nano- particles and Diels-Alder cycloadducts were conjugated to form a ther- mally responsive material [17]. Using iron oxide nanoparticles with anchored phosphonic acid groups, a network of furan-maleimide Diel- s-Alder cycloadducts was connected to discrete iron oxide nanoparticles. The resulting material underwent retro Diels-Alder reactions and de- compositions at 120 �C as demonstrated by differential scanning calo- rimetry. Having reversible cross-linked networks, with cross-linked iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles would be a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in self-healing and drug releasing technology. Given the ease and speciﬁcity in which they occur, Diel-Alder re- actions have been labeled “click chemistry” reactions [18]. Iron oxide nanoparticles and Diels-Alder linkers have been reported in the literature to form supramolecular complexes [15]. The Diels-Alder modiﬁed nanoparticles were attached to larger silica dioxide nanoparticles at multiple attachment points. For disassembly of the modiﬁed iron oxide nanospheres, the particles were heated up to 130 �C in DMSO for 24 h. The attachment efﬁciency and release rates of the spheres were depen- dent on the Diels-Alder cycloadducts linking the discrete nanoparticles together. Decreasing the energy barriers of the retro Diels-Alder would allow for either heat immersion or AMF-RF heating to dislocate the modiﬁed iron oxide nanoparticle spheres.

JCIS Open 4 (2021) 100034 release for these spheres could be accomplished by using different Diels-Alder cycloadducts. Beneﬁts of this technology have been reported in the literature and have possible applications in optics (i.e. imaging), catalysis, or medicine [19–24]. In another study comparing Diels-Alder cycloadducts, substituting the central atom (N, O, or S) of the diene had dramatic consequences in terms of reverse energy barriers [25]. Similarly, in studies using similar cycloadducts on the surface of silver nanoparticles, the payload release rate after light activation and photothermal heating was correlated to the diene that was used to initially form the cycloadduct [26]. The experi- mental results showed that the pyrrole based Diels-Alder cycloadduct had the largest percentage of total release followed by the furan and lastly the thiophene-based cycloadduct, in correlation with the predicted energy barriers by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, two different follow up studies were performed demonstrating controlled payload release using light activation in vitro and in vivo with silver nanoparticles and a furan-based Diels-Alder linker [27,28]. Studies demonstrating retro Diels-Alder mediated payload release using magnetic nanoparticles have also been reported [5,29]. In one study [5], the energy barriers of thiophene-based Diels-Alder linkers were modeled using DFT. The payload release rates from the surface of magnetic nanoparticles were predicted from these calculations and aligned with the speciﬁc loss power (SLP) values from the different magnetic nanoparticles used. A similar study demonstrated that a fur- furyl modiﬁed iron oxide nanoparticle could release a rhodamine payload through a retro Diels-Alder reaction when heated above 60 �C [29]. In this study, we further develop the previously investigated [5,26] maleimide-based Diels-Alder cycloadducts but with two singular thiophene-based dienes: 2-Thiophenemethanethiol (T-1) which was ob- tained commercially and 4,5-Dimethyl-N-(2-sulfanylethyl)-2-thiophene- carboxamide (T-2) which was synthesized (Fig. 1). To the best of our knowledge, the thiophene T-2 that was produced for this study has never been reported in the literature before. The retro Diels-Alder reactions with TDA-1 and TDA-2 were examined and compared on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Using density functional theory calculations, the forward and reverse energy barriers for these cycloadducts were pre- dicted. TDA-1 had a high reverse energy barrier, while TDA-2 possessed a low one. Heat immersion and AMF-RF hysteretic heating experiments were then performed on the modiﬁed nanoparticles, with payload release rates correlating with the predicted DFT calculated energy barriers. Additionally, Zeta potentials were determined for each type of modiﬁed iron oxide nanoparticles, demonstrating characteristic surface charge for the two different Diels-Alder cycloadducts. 2.

Sodium sulﬁte (ACS Reagent, �98%) and sodium hydroxide (�98%) were acquired from Honeywell Fluka (Morris Plains, NJ). Fluorescein-5-maleimide was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc (Waltham, MA), Sulfo-SMCC (Sulfosuccinimidyl-4(N-maleimidomethyl) Cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford, IL), potassium phosphate monobasic (1.5 M) from Rigaku Reagents (Bain- bridge Island, WA), tert-Butyl alcohol (99%) from Alfa Aesar (Tewksbury, MA), Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) from Cytiva (Pitts- burgh, PA), and 2-thiophenemethanethiol (>95%) from TCI America (Portland, OR). All reagents and solvents were used as received. 2.2. Computational methods All DFT calculations were performed using the NWChem 6.8 software package [30]. All geometry optimizations and frequency calculations were performed using the B3LYP functional and a 6–311g* basis set [31–34]. The numerical grid settings were set to extra ﬁne and all opti- mizations were performed using tight convergence criteria for the gradient, gradient maximum, root mean square, and Cartesian step maximum. A reduced atom model was used for the maleimide to reduce computational effort and ensure no negative vibrational modes were found for the products and reactants, and just a single negative vibra- tional mode for transition states. Transition state searches were per- formed by using optimized structures of the reactants initially constrained to 2.4 Å apart measured at bond forming carbon atoms. The thermodynamic data was obtained during the normal mode analysis simulations at 25, 40, 60, and 80 �C. All simulations were performed excluding any solvent effects. 2.3. Synthesis of Diels-Alder linkers Two different dienes were used in this study: 2- Thiophenemethanethiol (T-1) which was obtained commercially and 4,5-Dimethyl-N-(2-sulfanylethyl)-2-thiophenecarboxamide (T-2) which was synthesized as described in the Supporting Material Fig. S1 [35,36]. The general cycloaddition reaction between a thiophene-based diene and ﬂuorescein maleimide is illustrated in Fig. 1. TDA-1 was synthesized following a previously reported protocol with some minor modiﬁcations [5]. Brieﬂy, 0.36 μL of T-1 was combined with 5 mL of methanol in a glass vial. The pH of the solution was adjusted between 3.5 and 4 by addition of 1 M HCl. Fluorescein maleimide (2 mg) was then added to the glass vial prior to closing it, wrapping it in aluminum foil and heating it at 60 �C for 3 days. For the synthesis of TDA-2, 1.4 mg of T-2, 5 μL of TCEP, and 5 mL of methanol were mixed in a glass vial. The pH was lowered be- tween 3.5 and 4 by addition of 1 M HCl. Fluorescein maleimide (2 mg) was then added to the mixture. The glass vial was sealed, protected from light using aluminum foil, and heated at 60 �C in an oil bath for 3 days. The structures of TDA-1 and TDA-2 are reported in Fig. 1. Both cyclo- adducts were puriﬁed by column chromatography and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) as reported in the Supporting Material. 2.4. Synthesis of nanoparticles Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by coprecipitation of Fe2þ and Fe3þ ions in presence of NH4OH as previously reported [4,5,37]. Brieﬂy, 2 mL of FeCl2 . 4H2O (0.93 g) dissolved in 1 M HCl and 4 mL of FeCl3 . 6H2O (2.16 g) dissolved in 1 M HCl were combined with 54 mL of deionized water in a round-bottom ﬂask heated at 95 �C. NH4OH (12.5 mL of 28% NH3 in H2O solution) was slowly added and the mixture vigorously stirred for an hour. The solution was cooled down, and 1 M nitric acid was added to adjust the pH between 4 and 7. The mixture was then allowed to incubate at room temperature for 24 h. The nanoparticles were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation (30 min, 1300�g), and thoroughly washed three times with deionized water before getting dried. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the Fe3O4 nano- particles were obtained using a Malvern Panalytical Empyrean (3rd gen.) equipped with a Co source.

The authors compared two ferromagnetic ﬁne powders (total particle size, �350 nm and 100 nm), ﬁve superparamagnetic ferroﬂuidic samples (total particle size, 10–280 nm), and a commercially available contrast medium (ferumoxides injectable solution, Endorem).

Results. SARs varied considerably between the different iron oxide samples. The highest value was found for a ferroﬂu- idic sample (�93 W/g), while Endorem had little heating power (�0.1 W/g).

Such applications have exploited two major advantages of iron oxides: their low toxicity to human beings (4) and their magnetization. For example, the magnetization is used to target drugs to the tumor area through external static magnetic ﬁelds (5). The tumor elimination is con- ﬁned to the coupled cytotoxic drugs. If exposed to an alternating magnetic ﬁeld, the harmless iron oxide parti- cles become powerful heat sources by transforming the energy from the magnetic ﬁeld into heat. Gilchrist et al (6) ﬁrst proposed such an application, and several ap- proaches are currently under investigation for the treat- ment of tumors. One is called magnetic hyperthermia and involves the generation of temperatures up to 45°–47°C with iron oxides as particles (7) or as seeds (8). The treat- ment works by rendering cells more sensitive to radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Another technique, called mag- netic thermoablation (9), employs temperatures above 47°C, which have strong cytotoxic effects on both tumor and normal cells.

The heating of magnetic oxides in an alternating-cur- rent magnetic ﬁeld is due mainly to loss processes during reorientation of the magnetization (10) or frictional losses with particle rotations in low-viscous environments (11). A large heating power is desirable to reduce the material amount to be administered to the patient. For a reliable dosage, the heating power of the magnetic particles— commonly called the speciﬁc absorption rate (SAR) and describing the energy amount converted into heat per time and mass—has to be investigated thoroughly. Therefore, we determined the heating potential of various commer- cially available prototype iron oxide samples. The mag- netic material comprised both magnetic ﬁne powders and ferroﬂuid samples, which are colloidal suspensions of coated particles. Because particle immobilization can oc- cur in different molecular structures of the tumor area (eg, cellular membranes, proteins), the magnetic material was suspended in media in different states. MATERIALS AND METHODS Iron Oxide Samples The iron oxide samples were purchased from Heraeus (Hanau, Germany; sample 1), Ferroﬂuidics (Nu¨rtingen, Germany; sample 3), or Guerbet (Sulzach, Germany; feru- moxides injectable solution, Endorem, sample 7) or pro- vided by Chemicell GmbH (Berlin, Germany; samples 4–6, patent DE 196 24 426 A1). Sample 2 was prepared from sample 1 by grinding for about 300 hours. The fea- tures of these magnetic materials are summarized in the Table. Particle sizes and shapes were determined by means of scanning electron microscopy. With the excep- tion of Endorem, the investigated magnetic samples have not been tested for human applications. All iron oxide samples were chemically composed of nontoxic magnetite (Fe3O4). Suspension Media For SAR determinations, the iron oxide samples were suspended in media in different states, with studies in- cluding aqueous suspensions and suspensions in liquid and solid agar. The aqueous suspensions included 0.1 g of samples 1 and 2 per milliliter of distilled water. The fer- roﬂuid aqueous suspensions were measured as delivered without addition of distilled water. The liquid agar sus- pensions included 0.1 g of samples 1 and 2 and 0.1 mL of samples 3–7 per milliliter of liquid agar. The 2% wt/ vol agar solutions were measured in a liquid state after being heated to 50°C by a water-bath controlled thermo- stat. The mixtures were stirred during the calorimetric measurements (see below) to maintain a homogeneous particle suspension. For solid agar suspensions, identical particle concentrations were suspended in hot liquid agar, stirred until they cooled to the gelling point, and then measured in the solid state. Determination of Iron Oxide Mass in Ferroﬂuids For the ferroﬂuidic samples (samples 3–7), the iron oxide mass (mi) was determined by assuming that the fer- roﬂuids are composed mainly of water and iron oxides and that the mass of the iron oxides is much larger than that of the particle coatings (see Discussion).

Calorimetric Determination of the SAR For the calorimetric determination of the SAR, the iron oxide suspensions were thermally isolated in a vacuum vessel (dewar) and placed into a circular coil (diameter, 9 cm; two turns). To measure temperature changes over time during exposure to an alternating magnetic ﬁeld (am- plitude, 6.5 kA/m; frequency, 400 kHz), we used a ther- mocouple of copper and constantan wires (0.09 mm and 0.16 mm in diameter, respectively) connected to a mul- timeter with automatic registration (Keithley, Germering, Germany). In control experiments, the heating of the ther- mocouple without iron oxide samples was found to be negligible. The selection of the magnetic ﬁeld parameters was restricted by the technical limits of the available de- vice (EFD Induktionserwa¨rmung Fritz Du¨sseldorf GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) with a nominal output power of 5 kW. The nominally inductive coil was matched to the output impedance of the power ampliﬁer by the manufac- turer. The magnetic ﬁeld amplitude was measured with a pickup coil of known turn number and area by means of an oscillograph. The corresponding experimental setup is shown sche- matically in Figure 1a. From measured time-dependent temperature curves, the temperature-to-time variation for the start of heating (�T/�t) was calculated from regres- sion line a as shown schematically in Figure 1b. For ther- mally equilibrated samples (aqueous solutions of iron ox- ide particles, suspensions in solid agar) with steady tem- peratures before exposure to an alternating magnetic ﬁeld (line c in Fig 1b), the SAR was calculated by the follow- ing formula: SAR � �c � ms � �T/�t�/mi, (2) where c is the speciﬁc heat capacity of the sample, mi is the total iron oxide mass in the suspension, ms is the mass of the sample mixture, T is the temperature, and t is time. This means that the data were normalized with respect to the magnetite mass. In prototype experiments, the speciﬁc heat capacities of solid and liquid agar were found to be comparable to that of water. For samples that were not thermally equilibrated (those requiring heating to maintain agar in a liquid state) �T/�t from regression line a was corrected by the temperature variation with time, as ex- pressed by the slope of regression line b.

HILGER ET AL Academic Radiology, Vol 9, No 2, February 2002 200 were performed in triplicate. Data are presented as means and � standard deviations of the mean. RESULTS Distinct SARs were found for the different samples. Those for samples 1 and 2 are shown in Figure 2a. For sam- ple 1, the SARs differed depending on the states of the sus- pension medium; the SARs were signiﬁcantly higher for particles suspended in water (74 W/g) or liquid agar (51 W/g). For particles suspended in solid agar or after grinding, the SARs were comparatively low (�8 W/g). For the ferroﬂuidic iron oxide samples, there was no signiﬁcant correlation between the SAR and the particle suspension medium. Sample 3 had the highest SARs (73–93 W/g), and sample 7, the contrast medium En- dorem, showed almost no heating power (�0.1 W/g) for the magnetic ﬁeld parameters used (Fig 2b). DISCUSSION According to our data, the SARs of the different iron oxide samples vary considerably. Prepared by different procedures, the samples differ in particle size and shape (Table), which determine their magnetic properties and consequently their heating power (12). As mentioned with respect to Equation (1), the iron oxide mass mi can be calculated with satisfying accuracy only for particles with relatively thin coatings. Otherwise, the actual value of mi is smaller, and the SAR is higher than calculated. Therefore, the corresponding data for samples 4–7 were only roughly estimated. The heating potential for samples 1 and 2 in solid agar can be understood by the basis of multidomain particle behavior, which was theoretically predicted for nearly cubic grains with diameters larger than 100 nm (13). Ac- cording to this theory, heating is generated by domain wall displacement during exposure to an alternating mag- netic ﬁeld. This behavior is typical for ferromagnetic ma- terials. After the particle size of sample 1 was reduced by grinding (to produce sample 2, shown in the Table and Fig 2) the heating potential in liquid medium decreased markedly. Presumably, an increase in the coercivity force with mechanical work occurred (14), and coercivity forces higher than the amplitudes of the alternating-cur- rent magnetic ﬁeld may have reduced the heating power. The variation in the heating potential of sample 1 with the state of the suspension medium can be explained by the fact that there is an additional contribution to heating pro- duced by particle rotations or vibrations (the so-called rota- tional losses), which are increasingly inhibited by particle immobilization with increasing cross-linked agarose mole- cules in the surroundings. Speciﬁcally, when agar is heated the cross-links between the galactose polymers are broken, and when it is cooled the cross-links reform (15). This fact suggests that the heating potential of sample 1 in water is generated mainly by rotational losses. The observations with sample 1 exemplify the in vivo situation in which variations Figure 2. Heating powers of different iron oxide samples, as indicated by the SARs, for a frequency of 400 kHz and a magnetic ﬁeld amplitude of 6.5 kA/m. (a) Iron oxide in ﬁne powder form; sample 2 is produced by grinding sample 1. (b) Ferroﬂuidic samples (colloidal suspension of coated nanoparticles). The samples were suspended in aqueous, liquid (liquid agar), and solid (solid agar) media. Because samples 4–7 violate the precondition of Equation (1), the corresponding SARs represent only lower limits. Academic Radiology, Vol 9, No 2, February 2002 HEATING POTENTIAL OF IRON OXIDES 201 in SARs could reﬂect the degree of particle immobilization at the tumor area, for example, by bindings between residues of the coating and cellular membranes or matrix proteins. For unknown reasons, however, a comparable dependency was not observed after the grinding of sample 1 and the fer- roﬂuidic samples. The heating of samples 3–6 is due to relaxational losses occurring from rotation of the particle magnetiza- tion vector or mechanical rotation of the entire particle. The heating potential of ferroﬂuidic sample 7, a contrast medium widely used for the detection of liver lesions with magnetic resonance imaging, was negligible.

They can be activated through external stimuli or by the physico-chemical conditions present in cells or tissues. Here, we describe the preparation of hybrid iron oxide-manganese oxide core-satellite shell nanostructures that change their contrast mode in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from T2 to T1, after being internalized by cells. This occurs by the dissolution of the MnO2 of the shell, preserving intact the iron oxide at the core. First, we study the seeded-growth synthesis of iron oxide-manganese oxide nanoparticles studying the effect of varying the core size of the magnetic seeds and the concentration of the surfactant. This allows tuning the size and shape of the ﬁnal hybrid nanostructure. Then, we show that the shell can be removed by a redox reaction with glutathione, which is naturally present inside the cells at much higher concentrations than outside the cells. Finally, the dissolution of the MnO2 shell and the change in the contrast mode is conﬁrmed in cell cultures.

","The results revealed that, outside the cells, the core-satellite shell structure is preserved but, inside the cells, the MnO2 shell is dissolved (causing the switch from T2 to T1 contrast mode), leaving intact the IONP core for magnetic hyperthermia. 2.

Synthesis of nanoparticles Synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles. Iron oxide nanoparticles with different sizes (7, 10, 13, and 21 nm) were synthesized from organometallic precursors. The 7 nm nanoparticles were exclu- sively formed from the iron(III) acetylacetonate precursor while the other sizes were obtained by the iron oleate complex. The iron oleate complex was synthesized following the method reported by Hyeon et al. [19,20] Different nanoparticle sizes were synthesized by changing the reagent concentrations and the temperature slopes. [20] In a typical example, for 10 nm magnetic nanoparticles, a portion of the waxy reddish-brown oleate iron product (9 g, 10 mmol) was mixed with oleic acid (1.42 g, 5 mmol) in 50 mL of 1-octadecene. The dark solution was heated up to 100 �C with a constant rate of 2 �C�min�1 and it was kept at that temperature for 1 h under a nitrogen ﬂow. After that time, the N2 ﬂow was cut off, the system was heated up until reﬂux (around 320 �C) with the same constant rate and this plateau was kept for 3 h. When the synthesis ﬁnished, the heat was cut off and the reaction mixture could cool down to room temperature. Then, the dark product was washed by centrifugation with EtOH at 9000 rpm and the pre- cipitate was re-dispersed into n-hexane. For the 7 nm nanoparti- cles, Fe(acac)3 was used as metal-precursor. [21 22] In a typical synthesis, iron(III) acetylacetonate (1.766 g, 5 mmol) was mixed with 1,2-dodecanediol (2.025 g, 10 mmol), oleic acid (4.237 g, 15 mmol.) in 1-octadecene (50 mL) in a three-neck round- bottomed ﬂask with mechanical stirring under a N2 ﬂow at atmo- spheric pressure. It was heated with a constant rate of 2 �C�min�1 until the temperature reached 100 �C for 1 h. At that moment, the N2 ﬂow was cut off, the temperature was increased up to 200 �C with the same temperature rate and that plateau was kept for 60 min. Finally, the temperature was increased to the reﬂux (ap- prox. 320 �C) with a constant rate of 5 �C min�1 and kept for 2 h. The reaction was stopped and allowed to cool down to room tem- perature. The dispersion of nanoparticles was washed by centrifu- gation with ethanol repeatedly and stored in n-hexane. In all the cases, to be used as seeds in the following experi- ments, iron oxide nanoparticles were washed by ultrasonication with EtOH and magnetic precipitation. The process was carried out until obtaining a viscous black residue which was suspended into the minimum possible volume of 1-octadecene. Thus, just one stock dispersion per IONP size was prepared for all further experiments. The iron concentrations of the stock dispersions were determined by ICP-OES. Synthesis of IONPs-Mn oxide nanoparticles. To obtain the hybrid heterostructures, we used the IONPs previously dispersed in 1- octadecene with oleic acid and the Mn(acac)2 precursor. In a typi- cal example, Mn(acac)2 (1.266 g, 5 mmol) was mixed with oleic acid (4.237 g, 15 mmol) and a suspension of iron oxide seeds (75 mg of Fe), in 50 mL of 1-octadecene, into a three-neck round-bottomed ﬂask. The volume of iron oxide seeds added to the mixture was adjusted as a function of the iron concentration previously measured by ICP-OES and the volume of pure 1- octadecene added adjusted to get a ﬁnal volume of 50 mL in all experiments. The synthesis was heated up to 60 �C under a N2 ﬂow at a constant heating rate of 2 �C�min�1. The temperature was kept for 30 min, then the N2 ﬂow was cut off and the mixture was heated up again until reﬂux (320 �C) at a constant temperature rate of 20 �C�min�1. When the synthesis reached the boiling point, the temperature was kept constant for 30 min. The dispersion was allowed to cool down to room temperature and was washed sev- eral times by centrifugation with EtOH discarding the colorless supernatant by a magnet. The precipitate was stored for its further characterization in the minimum volume of n-hexane. Synthesis of Mn oxide nanoparticles. Manganese oxide nanoparti- cles with core sizes of 9 nm were synthesized to compare as a model for the satellite nanoparticles present in the hybrid’s nanos- tructures. Manganese(II) acetylacetonate (1.266 g, 5 mmol) and oleic acid (7.061 g, 25 mmol) were dissolved in 50 mL of 1- octadecene in a three three-neck round-bottomed ﬂask with mechanical stirring. The mixture was heated up to 60 �C at 2 �- C�min�1, keeping this temperature constant for 30 min. Then, the temperature was increased to 200 �C at a constant rate of 2 �- C�min�1. After 2 h at 200 �C. The reaction mixture was heated up again at a rate of 3 �C�min�1 until reﬂux, which was kept for 1 h before allowing the mixture to cool down to room temperature. Then, the resulting mixture was washed with ethanol and by cen- trifugation several times to obtain a brown precipitate that was redispersed in n-hexane for further use. Surface modiﬁcation with dopamine. Iron oxide-manganese oxide nanostructures were coated with DOPA following a previously reported method with slight modiﬁcations. [23] A volume of the hexane dispersion of the nanoparticles containing a mass of 85 mg of Fe + Mn (determined by ICP-OES) was washed several times with ethanol and ultrasonication to remove the oleic acid excess, using a magnet to obtain a black precipitate. Then, the hybrid nanostructures were suspended in THF (7 mL) and mixed with a solution of DOPA (225 mg) in THF (20 mL). The mixture was sonicated and shaken in a laboratory tube rotator overnight. Nanoparticles were transferred from the tube to a beaker and washed with a combination of different solvents. Firstly, the nanoparticles were dispersed THF (5 mL), sonicated for 5 min and precipitated with the aid of a magnet. Then, the precipitate was washed in a mixture of THF/EtOH (3 times, 3/12 mL each) removing the supernatant by magnetic decantation. Finally, the nanoparticles were suspended in distilled water (� 5 mL) and a solution of KOH 0.01 M was used to adjust the pH to 11. The black suspension was dialyzed in a cellulose membrane for 2 days in dis- tilled water before stabilizing the dispersion at physiological pH = 7.4 with KOH 0.01 M. 2.3. Characterization methods The sizes and morphologies of the different structures were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, 100 kV, JEOL JEM 1010 microscope). Samples in organic and aqueous solvent were prepared by placing one drop of a dilute suspension onto a carbon coated copper grid and leaving it to dry at room tempera- ture. Average size and size distributions were determined through manual analyses of, at least, 300 nanoparticles (or 300 satellite nanoparticles) for each sample in randomly selected areas of the micrographs, using ImageJ software. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy-high angle annular dark ﬁeld (STEM-HAADF) images were obtained with a Tecnai F30 (FEI) electron microscope oper- ated at 300 kV and the chemical analyses of the nanoparticles were performed by Energy Dispersive X-Ray microanalysis (EDX). The metal concentration (Mn, Fe) of each sample was measured by an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Perkin-Elmer Optima 2100 DV ICP). Samples were digested using an HCl: HNO3 3:1 mixture. The hydrodynamic diameters (DH) of aqueous samples were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS; Malvern Zetasizer D. García-Soriano, P. Milán-Rois, N. Lafuente-Gómez et al. Journal of Colloid and Interface Science 613 (2022) 447–460 449 Nano ZS Instrument, using a red laser at 633 nm and an angle of 173� between the sample and the detector). The pH of the samples in distilled water was adjusted to 7.4 with KOH 0.01 M. After lyophilization of the aqueous samples, X-ray diffraction patterns were acquired from the powder samples by a Bruker D8 Advance A25 system coupled with a PSD Lynseye XE detector (us- ing Cu Ka radiation, scan angle 2h = 10�-80� at a 0.02 scan step and positive discrimination). The crystallite sizes were determined from the Scherrer equation. XPS measurements were carried out under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions (with a base pressure of 5 � 10-10 mbar) using a monochromatic Al K-alpha line as the exciting photon source (hv = 1486.7 eV). The ejected electrons were collected in a hemi- spherical energy analyzer (SPHERA-U7, analyzer pass energy was set to 20 eV for the XPS measurements to have a resolution of 0.6 eV) and due to the insulating character of the samples, it was used a Flood Gun (FG-500, Specs) with low energy electrons of 3 eV and 40 lA to avoid charging effects. The aliphatic C 1 s was used as a binding energy reference centered at 284.6 eV. To determine the percentage of inorganic material present in the samples, simultaneous thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyses (TGA/DTA) were made in a TA Instruments TGA 500, with a heating rate of 10 �C�min�1, in air atmosphere from room tem- perature to 1000 �C. Magnetic characterization was carried out in a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM; MLVSM9 Mag Lab 2 T, Oxford Instrument). Approximately an amount of 3 mg of powder nanoparticles were compressed into a cellulose capsule with a cleaning cotton. After saturating the samples in a ﬁeld of 2 T, the ﬁeld-dependent magne- tization curves were acquired at room temperature. Magnetic sat- uration (MS) values are shown in A�m2/kg of c-Fe2O3, using the data acquired by TGA analyses to obtain the amount of inorganic material, and ICP-OES analyses to determine de Fe:Mn ratios. Heating abilities of nanoparticles in aqueous colloidal suspen- sion were measured with a commercial AC ﬁeld applicator DM100 (Nanoscale Biomagnetics) using a frequency of 202 kHz and a ﬁeld amplitude of 29.9 mT (24 kA�m�1). Experiments were carried out within a thermally insulated working space of about 1 cm3, using a closed container of 1 mL volume conditioned for measurements in the liquid phase. The temperature of the colloids was measured using an optic ﬁber sensor incorporated in the equipment and registered using a computer. The sample tempera- ture was recorded before applied the magnetic ﬁeld for about 50 s to ensure thermal stability. When the ﬁeld was turned on, the tem- perature increment was measured for 300 s. By performing a linear ﬁt of the data, the slope (dT�dt�1) was obtained from 15 to 45 s using. SAR values (W�gFe -1) were calculated with the equation SAR = C�(dT�dt�1)�(dsample�Vsample�mFe -1), where C is the speciﬁc heat of the sample, dsample and Vsample are the sample’s density and vol- ume, and mFe is the iron concentration in each suspension as deter- mined by ICP-OES. Because of the diluted concentration used for the measurements, C and dsample were assumed to be the speciﬁc heat capacity and density of water (4.18 J�g�1��C�1, 1 g�mL�1), respectively. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) were acquired in a 7 Tesla BioSpec 70/20 (Bruker, Germany) using a transmit-receive volume coil. To calculate the relaxivity times of r2 and r1 of the nanoparti- cles, T2 maps of pure water and several dilutions of each samples (0.034, 0.171, 0.342, 0.856, 1.71, 4.28 and 12.84 mM [Fe + Mn]) were acquired at different echo times (TE). For T2 mapping, a MSME (multi-slice multi-echo) sequence was used with the fol- lowing parameters: repetition time TR = 2000 ms; 25 echo times, each echo of 6.4 ms, from 6.4 ms to 159.6 ms; slice thickness = 1 mm; 1 average; FOV = 57.56 � 85 mm; matrix = 128 � 128. For T1 mapping, a RARE (rapid acquisition with refocused echo) sequence was used with the following parameters: 6 repetition time values TR = 200, 400, 800, 1500, 3000 and 5500 ms; echo time TE = 7 ms; slice thickness = 1 mm; 1 average; FOV = 57.6 � 80 mm; matrix = 192 � 256. Both relaxation times were obtained from the slope of the line that ﬁts the relationship between the concentra- tion and the inverse of T1 or T2. 2.4. Cell culture experiments Cell culture. Pancreatic cancer cells PANC-1 (ATCC� CRL-1469TM) and breast cancer cells MCF-7 (ATCC� HTB-22TM) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% streptomycin–penicillin and 1% L-glutamine. For all the experiments, the different cell lines were seeded for 24 h in several multi-well plates (96-well plates 10,000 cells per well, 24 well plates 60,000 cells per well, 6-well plates 180,000 cells per well). When the cells reached 60 % conﬂu- ency were treated with the chosen concentration of magnetic nanoparticles. Cell viability. Nanoparticle´s toxicity at different concentrations was studied using the alamarBlue assay. Cells were seeded in 96- well plates. Then, nanoparticles were incubated at different con- centrations for 24 h. After that time, cells were washed twice with PBS 1x and complete culture medium is added. Viability studies were performed the following two days, 48 and 72 h after treat- ment. For that, a stock solution of resazurin sodium salt (1 mg�mL�1) in PBS 1x was diluted 1 % (v/v) in complete medium and added to each experimental condition.

However, agglomeration vulnerability of the nano-heating agents in aqueous solutions, low control over the heat generation and dissipation at the target region, and eschewed clearance by the renal and reticuloendothelial systems remain as the main challenges for clinical translation of this approach. Here we report superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were synthesized by using a single precursor, stabilized with a controlled micellar conformation, and coated with a thin polycaprolactone biopolymer shell to achieve enhanced cytocompatibility and thermosensitivity under external alternating magnetic ﬁeld (AMF) of varied intensities. The in vitro investigations indicated a negligible inﬂuence of the polymer-coated SPIONs on cell viability of human liver cancer cells (HepG2) at a maximum concentration of 100 μg∙mL−1. However, the cell viability was reduced signiﬁcantly to 40.1 ± 0.9% within the secure hyperthermia temperature range achieved by the heating eﬀect of polymer-coated SPIONs in presence of AMF, depicting the on/oﬀ cytotoxicity phenomenon of polymer-coated SPIONs under AMF exposure. Therefore, the developed nanostructure presents a step-change as potential targeted nano-heating agents for new ther- apeutic options. 1. Introduction Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have ex- hibited a propitious opportunity in biomedical applications from mag- netic resonance imaging to drug delivery and magnetic hyperthermia therapy (MHT), owing to their promising therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities [1,2]. In particular, MHT is performed through infusion of SPION nanoﬂuids in the presence of an external alternating magnetic ﬁeld (AMF) to alter the metabolism of the heat shock proteins at the targeted tumor area, resulting in cellular degradation and apoptosis [3,4]. Nanoparticle-mediated cancer treatments necessitate adequate sta- bility in aqueous media at neutral pH and physiological salinity. ","The in vitro magnetic hyperthermia tests were performed on both groups under the exposure of the external AMF at 31.49 and 47.24 kA∙m−1, based on the obtained results from induction heating section. After the exposure, the cells were incubated for 24 h, thenceforward, the cells were placed in a 96- well plate, followed by MTT assay to compare the cell viabilities of the treated cells exposed to diﬀerent AMF strengths with those of control groups. 2.9. Data analysis At least three experimental replications were performed for all ex- periments and the obtained results were expressed as the means ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was carried out using one- way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey corrections through Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS; version 25, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results were considered signiﬁcant at 95% con- ﬁdence interval (P < 0.05). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of surfactant micellar conformation Based on the concentrations, surfactant molecules often arrange in three main micellar conﬁgurations on the nanoparticles surface in- cluding hemi, ad, and mixed hemi-ad micelles (Fig. 4). In the hemi micellar arrangement, a surfactant monolayer is formed on the nano- particles surface via coulombic attraction. With the increment of the absorbed surfactant, the hydrophobic interactions among the hydro- carbon chains of the surfactant molecules lead to their bilayer ar- rangement on the nanoparticles surface and formation of the ad-mi- cellar conﬁguration. A mixed hemi-ad micelle array is also formed at Fig. 3. A schematic view of the functionalization and coating of CTAB-modiﬁed iron oxides. An ad-micellar structure was formed on the particles surface and then CTAB molecules were attached with PCL-d chains. Z. Hedayatnasab, et al. European Polym er Journal 133 (2020) 109789 4 intermediate surfactant concentrations, with both coulombic and hy- drophobic interactions [20,31]. The formation of each conﬁguration could be determined via ζ measurements, where the low and high ζ- values indicate the presence of hemi and ad micelles, respectively. Fig. 4 illustrates the ζ changes of iron oxide samples with addition of varied surfactant quantities. When CTAB was added into the synthesis solution, their positively-charged hydrophilic heads electrostatically bonded to the hydroxyl groups of iron oxide, resulting in neutral charges. Therefore, the ζ-value progressively raised from −30 ± 3 mV (for bare iron oxide at pH ~9) to zero at CTAB quantity of 5 mL, conﬁrming formation of hemi micelles around particles through elec- trostatic interaction. Notably, the hydrophobic interactions among the tail groups of the surfactant molecules is the primary driving force for their ad-micellar conﬁguration in the aqueous medium. Therefore with increase of the CTAB concentration, free hydrophobic polar tails as- semble together via chain-to-chain reactions and the polar heads be- come exposed, leading to positive ζ-values [20,31]. This trend con- tinued to reach the maximum ζ-value of +16 ± 2 mV in CTAB concentration of 15 mg, indicating formation of ad-micellar conﬁg- uration of the CTAB molecules on the particles surface. Thereby, this surfactant quantity (SPC15) was considered as the critical concentration for ad-micellar conﬁguration (CaMC) and the optimal amount for sur- face modiﬁcation of iron oxides for further attachment of the PCL-d chains. When PCL-d was added into the solution, the ζ-value signiﬁcantly reduced to around −8 ± 2 mV (P < 0.05), implying PCL-d coating layer was formed around particles surface through electrostatic inter- actions. The presence of unreacted diol groups on the polymer changes probably contributed in generation of negative charges on the coated iron oxides. 3.2. Morphological studies The morphological characteristics of bare iron oxides, SPC15, and PCL-SPC15 are illustrated in Fig. 5a-d. The TEM micrographs clearly showed all the synthesized nanoparticles with a uniformly distributed spherical shape. Meanwhile, surface modiﬁcation by the cationic sur- factant could slightly improve the particle dispersity in the aqueous medium, probably due to particle-particle interactions [6,29]. Ac- cording to Fig. 5c, no signiﬁcant alteration in nanoparticles dispersity and agglomeration was observed by further coating of the SPC15 par- ticles with PCL biopolymer. A typical TEM image from an individual nanoparticle with higher magniﬁcation is also illustrated in Fig. 5d, which obviously conﬁrms formation of a core-shell structure comprised of iron oxide core and PCL shell. Fig. 6a-b depicts the particle size distribution of bare iron oxides, SPC15, and PCL-SPC15 matched well with Gauss ﬁtting curve. As a result of polymer coating, the mean diameter of nanoparticles was increased from 18 ± 2 to 21 ± 3 nm, indicating formation of a 3 nm polymer coating on the bare iron oxide nanoparticles. 3.3. Phase structure The obtained XRD patterns on bare iron oxide, SPC15, and PCL- SPC15 are illustrated in Fig. 7a-c. The XRD patterns conﬁrmed forma- tion of a single magnetite phase (JCPDS 00-001-1111) with cubic spinel and Fd3-m space group in all samples, implying the negligible eﬀects of CTAB and PCL on the crystalline phase of iron oxides. The XRD dif- fraction peaks of all samples observed at 2θ values of 18.45°, 30.37°, 35.74°, 43.41°, 53.93°, 57.40°, 62.98°, and 74.46° respectively corre- sponded to (1 1 1), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (4 2 2), (5 1 1), (4 4 0), and (5 3 3) family planes of magnetite (PDF 89-4319). The XRD Patterns of PCL-SPC15 illustrates the presence of two crystalline polymeric and metallic phases. The added peaks at 2θ of 21.4 and 23.7 (Fig. 7c) are represented the crystallographic planes of (1 1 1) and (2 2 0), respectively [32]. The HRTEM image in Fig. 8 also depicts an interlayer spacing of 0.254 nm for Fe3O4 cores in PCL-SPC15, which is well-matched with the (3 1 1) planes of magnetite (PDF 89-4319) possessing an interlayer spacing of 0.251 nm. 3.4. Chemical investigation The FTIR spectra of bare Fe3O4, pure CTAB, SPC15, pure PCL bio- polymer, and PCL-SPC15 are shown in Fig. 9a-e. FT-IR spectra of bare Fe3O4 clearly displays absorption peaks of 3401.22 and 1627.56 cm−1, which were respectively characteristics of stretching and bending vi- brations of hydroxyl functional group (HeOeH), required for electro- static assembly of CTAB molecules [33]. The peaks in the low-frequency region from 500 to 800 cm−1, particularly at 583.83 cm−1 attributed to FeeO absorption bands which conﬁrmed the presence of the magnetite. The presence of 3017.13 cm−1 band could be attributed to the vibra- tions of the ammonium moiety in CTAB. Additionally, the peaks at around 2848.39 and 2916.37 cm−1 were related to symmetric and antisymmetric CeH vibration bands of the eCH2 group which derived from the long aliphatic tail of CTAB. The peaks at 1461.31 and 959.90 cm−1 were associated with asymmetric stretching vibration of N+eCH3, besides the peak 718.36 cm−1 might be corresponded to Br− [6]. FTIR spectrum of PCL biopolymer possessed a strong band at 1719.73 cm−1 that could be assigned to carbonyl stretching (C]O groups). In addition, the bands at 2941.44 and 2863.81 cm−1 were related to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of aliphatic CeH groups, while absorption bands at 1238.09 and 1159.51 cm−1 were belonged to asymmetric and symmetric stretching of CeOeC group in PCL, respectively [34]. The recorded spectra for PCL-SPC15 (Fig. 9e) was identical to that of pure PCL and exhibited the same characteristic vibration bands of Fe3O4 with slightly lower intensities owing to the presence of active components. Fig. 10a depicts the low-resolution XPS survey spectra of PCL-SPC15 while high-resolution C 1s, O 1s, and Fe 2p XPS spectra of the PCL- SPC15 are shown in Fig. 10b-d. The Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 10d) com- prised of the doublet Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 possessed the binding en- ergy values of 723.72 eV and 710.44 eV respectively, which were considered as the common peaks for magnetite. The peaks from such spectra were probably deconvoluted into two components correlated with Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions. These results implied that the composition of the Fe3O4 core was unaﬀected by surfactant and polymer modiﬁcations. The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 10c) could be also deconvoluted into four peaks ascribed to the oxygen atoms from Fe-O, OH (Fe2O3), CeO/C]O, and COOH located at 529.82, 530.29, 531.46 and 532.38 eV, respectively [35]. The C 1s spectrum (Fig. 10b) included the contribution of four components peaks situated at 284.58, 285.49, 286.65 and 288.53 eV were respectively corresponded to carbon atoms of CeC, CeO, C]O Fig. 4. Diﬀerent conﬁgurations of surfactant molecules around the iron oxide particles at varied CTAB quantities. Three main micellar structures are de- termined based on changes of the ζ-values of samples. Z. Hedayatnasab, et al. European Polym er Journal 133 (2020) 109789 5 and COOH from PCL, which were well-matched to previous other report [36]. Both XRD and XPS studies conﬁrmed that PCL biopolymer was successfully coated on the SPC15 surface. 3.5. Thermal analysis DSC technique was performed to evaluate the phase transition be- havior of pure PCL and PCL-SPC15 samples. As shown in Fig. 11a, the peak temperature of endothermic phase transition for pure PCL was observed at 52.1 ± 2 °C [37]. However, the onset temperature of this phase transition was initiated at 45.4 ± 2 °C, implying that the melting point of PCL polymer with molecular weight of 2000 Da was within the upper hyperthermia range (45 to 52 °C). The DSC thermograms of the PCL-SPC15 also elucidated insigniﬁcant alterations of the onset and peak temperatures of endothermic phase transition of PCL after coating on the metallic core. This range of phase transition temperature in the PCL-SPC15 particles conﬁrmed their appropriacy for cancer therapy under hyperthermia condition. Fig. 5.

European Polym er Journal 133 (2020) 109789 6 TGA analysis was also carried out to determine the quantities of CTAB and PCL in the core-shell nanostructure. As shown in Fig. 11b, the curve of SPC15 depicts a small weight loss of around 3%, which could be attributed to the evaporation of CTAB. On the contrary, the TGA measurement of PCL-SPC15 exhibited a mass loss of approximately 12% in two phases. The ﬁrst phase of weight loss correlated with CTAB evaporation at temperatures below 300 °C, while an additional weight loss of approximately 9% at 300–400 °C in the second phase attributed to degradation of PCL to CO2, CO, and H2O [38]. The obtained PCL quantity was comparable with the value obtainable from the TEM images (9%), based on the theoretical densities of Fe3O4 and PCL.

In this paper, monodisperse  spherical α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were prepared by hydrothermal method using FeCl3, NaHCO3 and Na2SO4 as  reactants. Then monodisperse Fe/SiO2 nanoparticles with core/shell structure were obtained by coating SiO2 on  the surface of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and reducing at 500℃ in hydrogen atmosphere. The diameter of Fe core is  about 230 nm and the thickness of SiO2 coating is about 75 nm. Magnetic measurements show that Fe/SiO2  nanoparticles exhibit typical ferromagnetic properties with Ms about 132.5 emu/g at 25 ℃. As-obtained Fe/SiO2  nanoparticles have higher heating efficiency than superparamagnetic ferrite nanoparticles. The high heating  ability of the Fe/SiO2 nanoparticles is estimated to be related to the hysteresis loss and Brownian relaxation  mechanism during alternating magnetization.

","The results show that Fe/SiO2 nanoparticles are promising for the  applications of magnetic hyperthermia and thermal ablation. 1. Introduction  In recent years, magnetic nanoparticles have attracted great atten- tion due to their huge potential applications in magnetic targeted drug  release, magnetic resonance imaging, and local thermotherapy [1–3]. The application of ferromagnetic nanoparticles in magnetic hyperther- mia and thermal ablation treatment of tumors is one of the most inter- esting research topics [4–7]. A major advantage of magnetic  hyperthermia and thermal ablation therapy is that it can locally generate  heat and selectively kills malignant tumor cells [8]. Therefore, the drug  dose required is small and the side effects on the human body are low. So far, quite a lot of research on the possibility of magnetic nano- particles used in magneto-hyperthermia has been carried on. But most of  the researches are focused on superparamagnetic iron oxide nano- particles [9–13]. With the lower energy conversion rate, it is necessary  to increase the injection dose of such ultra-small iron oxide nano- particles to achieve the expected magnetic hyperthermia effect [14] in  most practical clinical applications. To further improve the efficiency of  heat generation, materials with high magnetic moments have attracted  more and more attention from researchers [15,16]. Theoretically, the  heat generation mechanism of superparamagnetic iron oxide nano- particles usually includes N´eel relaxation and Brownian relaxation [17]. N´eel relaxation is generated by the rotation of the magnetic moment  around the crystal axis inside the nanocrystal. Under the alternating  magnetic field, the rotating motion of the magnetic moment converts the  magnetic field energy into heat energy. Energy generated by Brownian  relaxation is caused by the rotation and friction of particles in the so- lution under an alternating magnetic field. However, for ferromagnetic  nanoparticles, besides N´eel relaxation and Brownian relaxation, hys- teresis loss is another important source of heat generation [18]. It is well  known that ferromagnetic materials have hysteresis characteristics, and  the area of the hysteresis loop represents the energy loss per unit volume  [19]. The hysteresis loss increases with the increase of magnetic in- duction intensity and anisotropy barrier. The high saturation magneti- zation and large magnetocrystalline anisotropic barrier of ferromagnetic  nanoparticles help them to become efficient heat sources in magnetic  hyperthermia therapy, especially thermal ablation therapy [20]. Ferromagnetic metals, including Fe, Co, Ni and FeCo, FeNi alloy nano- particles, have high magnetic moments, but the poor chemical stability  and biocompatibility limit their applications in the biomedical field. * Corresponding author.

Here, we present a facile chemical method to synthesize mono- disperse ferromagnetic Fe/SiO2 composite nanoparticles, and found that  the nanoparticles have strong heating ability under alternating magnetic  field. As-prepared ferromagnetic nanoparticles are expected to have  potential applications in the fields of magnetic hyperthermia, thermal  ablation, etc. 2. Experiments  2.1. Materials  Ferric chloride hexhydrate (FeCl3⋅6H2O), sodium bicarbonate  (NaHCO3), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), ethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98 %)  and ammonia (28 %) were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent  Company. All the chemicals are analytical grade and directly used as  received without any further purification. The water used in the  experiment was de-ionized water. 2.2. Synthesis of monodisperse spherical α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles  20 mL FeCl3⋅6H2O (0.02 mol/L), 48 mL NaHCO3 (1 mmol/L) and 12  mL Na2SO4 (1 mmol/L) were mixed together, magnetically stirred for  10 min, and transferred into a stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of  100 mL, and heated for reaction at 220℃ for 10 h. After the reaction, the  autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The products were centrif- ugally separated from the solution, washing with de-ionized water and  ethanol repeatedly, drying at 60℃, and collecting for later use. 2.3. Preparation of monodisperse Fe/SiO2 nanoparticles  60 mg α-Fe2O3 powder was ultrasonically dispersed in de-ionized  water of 50 mL to obtain a brick-red suspension. 0.5 mL TEOS and 3  mL absolute ethanol were added into the suspension under stirring to  form a well-mixed solution. Subsequently, 5 mL ammonia was added  drop wise. The reaction lasted for 30 min in an ice water bath. Finally,  the products were magnetically separated from the solution, washing  with de-ionized water and ethanol repeatedly, drying at 60℃, to obtain  α-Fe2O3/SiO2 composite nanoparticles. The product above is placed in a quartz tube, reduced in a hydrogen  atmosphere at 500 ◦C for 30 min to obtain the final Fe/SiO2 composite  nanoparticles. 2.4. Characterization  The d8-advance 3.0 X-ray diffraction (XRD) produced by Bruker in  Germany was used for phase analysis of the samples. The field emission  scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-7000F) and high resolution  transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL-2100F) were used to  analyze the morphology of the sample. The energy-dispersive X-ray  spectroscopy (EDS) line scans were performed on Scios 2 Dual-Beam FIB  SEM to analyze the chemical composition of the particles. Quantum  Design’s SQUID comprehensive physical property analyzer was used to  test the magnetic properties of the product. To evaluate the heat generation efficiency of Fe/SiO2 composite  nanoparticles, the Fe/SiO2 nanoparticles were ultrasonically dispersed  in physiological saline of 5 mL to form a colloidal solution with a con- centration of 10 mg/mL. The colloidal solution was placed in a trans- parent biological glass test tube, and the instantaneous temperature of  the solution was measured with a kerosene thermometer under an  alternating magnetic field to evaluate the heating performance of the  sample. The alternating magnetic field was generated by an alternating  magnetic field generator, the alternating excitation coil is composed of 5  turns of copper pipe, and the coil temperature is controlled at 23℃ by  circulating cooling water. 3. Results and discussion  The SEM and TEM images of the synthesized α-Fe2O3 and Fe/SiO2  composite nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen from Fig. 1a  that the α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles produced by the hydrothermal reaction  are typical monodisperse spherical nanoparticles with particle size  about 240 nm. After being coated with SiO2 and reduced at 500℃ in  hydrogen atmosphere, the products still maintain monodisperse spher- ical morphology, as shown in Fig. 1b and1c. Due to the presence of the  SiO2 coating layer, the overall particle size increases to about 380 nm. It  can be further seen from the enlarged TEM image in Fig. 1d that the  coated and reduced particles have a typical core/shell structure. The  darker area in the center of the particle represents Fe core with a  diameter of about 230 nm formed after reduction. The lighter colored  peripheral portion represents the SiO2 coating layer, with a thickness of  about 75 nm. It can also be seen from Fig. 1d that after the hydrogen  reduction process at 500 ◦C, the sphericity of the Fe/SiO2 composite  particles maintains well, and there is no obvious agglomeration and  adhesion between the particles. In order to confirm the chemical  composition of the core and shell of the particles, EDS analysis was  performed on the as-synthesized Fe/SiO2 nanoparticles. The result is  shown in Figure S1. The distribution profiles of Si and Fe elements  further prove that the synthesized Fe/SiO2 nanoparticles have a typical  core–shell structure. The product reduced can be readily re-dispersed in  physiological saline and other solvents with the assistance of ultrasonic  vibration. The uniform colloidal solution formed after dispersion shows  high response ability to external magnetic field. When the magnet ap- proaches the solution, the magnetic particles quickly gather toward the  magnet. When the magnet is moved away, the magnetic particles are  rapidly re-dispersed in the medium. Fig. 2 shows the XRD results of the samples before and after  hydrogen reduction. As can be seen from Fig. 2 that all the diffraction  peaks of the samples synthesized by the hydrothermal method corre- spond to the XRD characteristic peaks of the rhombohedra α-Fe2O3  phase (hematite) provided in the standard PDF card (JCPDS file  89–0597). No impurity peaks of β-FeOOH, Fe3O4 or γ-Fe2O3 appear,  indicating that the sample is composed of high purity α-Fe2O3 phase. The sharp diffraction peaks indicate that the sample obtained is well  crystallized. The XRD diffraction peaks of the reduced sample agree with  the characteristic peaks of the cubic α-Fe phase provided in the standard  PDF card (JCPDS file 65–4899). The diffraction peaks at the diffraction  angle of 2θ = 44.6◦ and 65.0◦ correspond to the (110) and (200) crystal  planes of α-Fe phase respectively. No other impurity peaks can be  observed, indicating that α-Fe2O3 is completely reduced into pure Fe  metal after reduction in hydrogen atmosphere at 500℃. The flat  amorphous diffraction peak near 2θ = 20◦ in the XRD diffraction spec- trum implies that the SiO2 in the reduced product is in amorphous form. In order to confirm the chemical composition of the core and shell of the  particles, EDS analysis was performed on the as-synthesized Fe/SiO2  nanoparticles. The result is shown in Figure S1. The distribution profiles  of Si and Fe elements further prove that the synthesized Fe/SiO2 nano- particles have a typical core–shell structure. The SiO2 coating layer not  only helps to improve the hydrophilicity of the particles, but also pre- vents corrosion and oxidation caused by the interaction between inter- nal Fe nanoparticles and surrounding medium. Further experiments  show that the XRD diffraction spectrum of Fe/SiO2 sample stored in air  and normal saline for 3 months has no significant change compared with  its initial state, indicating that the product has high chemical stability, as  shown in Figure S2. It is well known that α-Fe2O3 crystal belongs to the hexagonal crystal  system. Due to the inconsistent growth rate of different crystal planes in  the hydrothermal reaction process, rod-like, needle-like, sheet-like and  other polyhedral shapes are easy to appear in the product. The formation  Q.-J. Sun et al. Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 565 (2023) 170275 3 of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles with different shapes is mainly related to the  selective adsorption of the additives of NaHCO3 and Na2SO4 on different  crystal planes, which causes the crystals to grow along a specific di- rection. Since FeCl3 generates H+ during the hydrolysis reaction to form  α-Fe2O3, the local portion of the solution appears to be acidic (pH less  than 7.0). Under acidic environment and high temperature of 220 ◦C,  the initially formed particles may locally dissolve with the following  reaction:  Fe2O3 + 6H+→2Fe3+ + 3H2O (1)  Therefore, during the formation of α-Fe2O3 particles, the crystalli- zation process and the dissolution process proceed simultaneously. The sulfate ions play a major role in the dissolution of α-Fe2O3 par- ticles. When the concentration of sulfate ions is high, the resulting  particles tend to be flake-shape. Sulfate ions and ferric ions will react  according to the following equation:  Fe3+ + xSO2− 4 →[Fe(SO4)x]3−2x (2)  The bicarbonate ion can be adsorbed on the specific crystal planes of  the α-Fe2O3 particles, which restrict the growth of the corresponding  crystal planes. Thus, the synergistic effect of bicarbonate and sulfate can  determine the final morphology of α-Fe2O3 particles. During the  experiment, it is found that when the molar ratio of HCO− 3 and SO2− 4 is  relatively small (1:4), the morphology of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles obtained  are in the form of flakes. As the ratio of the two ions increases to 4:1, the  morphology of the particles is nearly spherical shape. The morphology  of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles will affect the morphology of the particles after  the subsequent SiO2 coating, and it also affect the morphology of the  final reduction product. Therefore, controlling the morphology of  α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and obtaining spherical nanoparticles is one of  the important goals pursued in this experiment. To further investigate the magnetic properties of the product, the  room temperature magnetism of the sample before and after reduction  was tested with SQUID, and the results are shown in Fig. 3.

Introduction  Magnetite (Fe3O4) is one of the most studied and technologically  used iron oxides [1,2]. It exhibits an inverse spinel crystal structure  characterised by the packing of oxygen ions in a face-centered cubic  (fcc) arrangement. Between the oxygen ions, Fe3+ and Fe2+ occupy  tetrahedral and octahedral interstices [3,4]. The chemical composition  is represented by the formula (Fe3+)A[Fe2+Fe3+]BO4. For stoichiometric  magnetite, the ratio between Fe2+ and Fe3+ is 1:2, where Fe3+ ions are  located in the tetrahedral interstices, and both Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions  occupy the octahedral interstices. Owing to their equal distribution  between tetrahedral and octahedral positions [5], the Fe3+ ions do not  create a net magnetic moment. By contrast, the Fe2+ ions solely occupy  the octahedral sites and thus give rise to the magnetism of the material. “Bulk magnetite exhibits ferrimagnetic behaviour, a high Curie tem- perature (≈850 K), high saturation magnetisation (92 emu/g, T = 20 ◦C), and a coercivity between 200 and 400 Oe Fe3O4 nanoparticles  (NPs) with sizes below ≈20 nm exhibit superparamagnetic behaviour  [6,7]. In this case, the saturation magnetisation (Ms), remaining mag- netisation (Mr), and coercivity (Hc) vary according to the size of the NPs  [3]. Currently, commercialised superparamagnetic nanoparticles are  produced using chemical methods owing to the greater control they  allow over the size, shape, and chemical composition [8,9]. The most  common chemical routes are sol–gel synthesis [10–12], co-precipitation  * Corresponding author. E-mail address: sabrinarcaro@yahoo.com.br (S. Arcaro).

Most commercially available super- paramagnetic  iron  oxide  nanoparticles  are  synthesized  via  co-precipitation. This technique involves the simultaneous precipitation  of saline solutions of Fe2+ and Fe3+ by the addition of a base [26,27]. However, magnetite nanoparticles obtained by the co-precipitation  method do not possess uniform chemical and physical properties  owing to the occurrence of nucleation, growth, and/or agglomeration  processes [28,29]. In addition, the produced particles have a wide range  of size distributions and a low degree of crystallinity. Another disad- vantage is that the synthesis must be performed in an inert atmosphere  [30]. Alternative magnetite synthesis methods are complex; in addition  to an inert atmosphere, expensive, toxic reagents or complex experi- mental setups are required [31]. The sol–gel method is a  well-established synthetic approach for preparing nanoparticles from  metal oxides and mixed-oxide compounds [32]. The formation of metal  oxides involves several steps. In traditional methods, the corresponding  metal precursor undergoes rapid hydrolysis to produce a stable colloidal  solution (sol) of metal hydroxide. Hydrolysis is immediately followed by  condensation, which leads to the formation of three-dimensional (3D)  gels through electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, or covalent  bonding. Subsequently, the obtained gel is subjected to a drying process,  and the resulting product is readily converted into a xerogel or aerogel  depending on the drying method [33]. The synthesis is carried out at  room temperature, and the obtained nanoparticles undergo heat treat- ment to improve their crystallinity. Compared to other chemical tech- niques, sol–gel citrate–nitrate synthesis has numerous advantages such  as low cost, good homogeneity, and high purity [34]. Metallic oxides can  be obtained at low temperatures if the equivalence ratios of the pre- cursors are well adjusted. Works that address magnetite sol-gel synthesis in the literature  address temperatures always above 200 ◦C [35–42] and different re- agents and additives for pH modifications [35,37,43]. In most works  ethyleneglycol is used as a complexing agent. Mainly, in this case,  temperatures above 400◦C need to be used to eliminate organic com- pounds. Likewise, temperatures above 500◦C already demonstrate the  emergence of the hematite phase. Some works try to solve this problem  with pH control. Usually, ammonia is used to raise the pH to values  between 7 and 10 and reduce the possibility of hematite precipitation. Other cases use ferric chlorides as a source of iron, ethanol, dime- thylformamide as a solvent, or picric acid as a weak explosive agent. Even so, temperatures above 400◦C need to be used for phase formation. In all cases, the ratios between the reagents were kept constant. In this context, this work aimed to develop, for the first time, a  process for the synthesis of superparamagnetic magnetite nanoparticles  using the citrate-nitrate sol-gel method followed by heat treatment at  low temperature. Whereas we use citric acid and ferric nitrate, in  different ratios of equivalence to obtain nanometric and super- paramagnetic particles of magnetite. 2. Materials and methods  Magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) were prepared by sol–gel cit- rate–nitrate synthesis followed by heat treatment. Ferric nitrate non- ahydrate (Fe(NO3)3.9H2O; NEON, 98% purity) was used as the iron  precursor and anhydrous citric acid (C6H8O7; SYNTH, 99.5% purity) as  the complexing agent. The citrate:nitrate equivalence ratios (χ) were  0.30 (excess nitrate), 0.85 (stoichiometric), and 1.40 (excess citrate). These reagents and synthesis conditions were chosen based on a syn- thesis described in a previous study [43], while the equivalence ratios  were selected based on propellant chemistry and the different reducing  potentials of the species involved [44], leading to the generation of  oxidising  (0.30),  stoichiometric  (0.85),  and  reducing  (1.40)  environments. Initially, the reagents were separately dissolved in 25 mL of  deionised water. They were then homogenised, and the solution was  maintained at 85 ± 2 ◦C for 2 h under magnetic stirring (Are-  F20500162, Velp Scientifica) in a hot water bath. The resulting gel from  the synthesis process was dried in an oven at 100 ± 2 ◦C for 24 h (Ce-  220/100, CienLab). After drying, the dry gel (xerogel) was transferred to  an alumina crucible and heated in a vacuum oven (SP - 104/27, SPLA- BOR) at different temperatures and for varying durations, according to  the experimental design. To determine the heat treatment temperature and evaluate the heat  release and mass loss reactions that may occur, the thermal behaviour of  the xerogels was evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and  differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (SDT Analyser, Q600, TA In- struments). The analyses were performed at a heating rate of 10 ◦C/min  in synthetic air in the temperature range of 25–400 ◦C. To identify the  gases from the citrate–nitrate autoignition process, two characterisation  techniques were used: i) Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy  (BRUKER/TENSOR II) coupled with TGA (NETZSCH/STA 449 F3  Jupiter) to determine the functional groups of the gases formed; and ii)  mass spectrometry (QMS 403, NETZSCH) to dissociate and identify the  gases released from the gels during combustion. The heat treatment  temperatures defined from the analyses were 130, 150, and 170 ◦C for  durations of 2, 4, and 8 h, distributed in a 22 factorial experimental  design with a central point performed in duplicate (Table 1). The  factorial design matrix and treatment of the statistical data were per- formed using STATISTICA® 13.0 and analysis of variance (ANOVA). A  quadratic model was applied owing to the two-level factorial experi- ments using central points. The specific surface areas and pore sizes of the samples were deter- mined by applying the–Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Bar- rett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) models to the N2 adsorption isotherm using  a surface-area and pore-size analyser (Quantachrome Instruments  version 11.03) by adsorption of N2 at 77.3 K.  The crystal structures of the samples were characterised using an X-  ray diffractometer (XRD; D-5000 Bruker AXS) equipped with a Cu-Kα  radiation source (1.54178 Å). The samples were rotated to minimise the  effect of the preferred orientation and analysed in powder form using a  step size of 0.01◦, dwell time of 10 s per step, and 2θ range of 5–75◦,  scanned with slit divergence and an anti-scattering of 0.2 mm. Inorganic  crystal structure database (ICSD) databases were used to identify the  resulting crystalline phases. The crystallite sizes and lattice parameters  were determined after refinement of the structures using the Rietveld  method [45]. The lattice parameters, occupancy, degree 3 polynomial  background, peak scale, and form factors were refined. Goodness of fit  (GoF) was used to describe the quality of refinement. The Scherrer  equation was applied from the perspective of the widening of the re- flections of the existing crystalline phases, allowing the calculation of  the lower limit of the crystallite size [46] according to Equation (1):  D = 0, 9λ β cos θ (1)   where λ, θ, and β are the X-ray wavelength (0.15418 nm for Cu-Kα),  Bragg diffraction angle, and width at half the height of the most inten- sive diffraction peak, respectively. The sizes and shapes of the particles were analysed using a trans- mission electron microscope (MET, JEM 2–100) with a maximum ac- celeration voltage of 100 kV.

Polla et al. Ceramics International 49 (2023) 7322–7332 7324 M¨ossbauer spectroscopy was used to evaluate the hyperfine param- eters of the nanoparticles. Experiments were performed at room tem- perature in transmission geometry and constant acceleration mode using  a57Co/Rh γ-ray source (Wissel equipment). The spectra were adjusted  using the least-squares fitting method of discrete Lorentzian peaks for  each hyperfine iron site. The isomeric shift was calibrated in relation to  metallic iron. The magnetic parameters were obtained from the mag- netic hysteresis loop using a vibrating sample magnetometer (Modelo  EZ9, Microsense). Using the M × H curves, the values of some magnetic  parameters were determined, such as coercivity (HC), remanent mag- netisation (MR), and saturation magnetisation (MS). 3. Results and discussion  3.1. Influence of the citrate–nitrate equivalence ratio  To evaluate the influence of the citrate–nitrate equivalence ratio on  the autoignition temperature and consequently on the formation of the  Fe3O4 phase of interest, the xerogels were subjected to thermal analyses. Fig. 1 shows the DSC/TGA curves of the samples obtained using χ values  of 0.30 (excess nitrate), 0.85 (stoichiometric), and 1.40 (excess citrate). In the DSC curve for the sample with χ = 0.30, an intense exothermic  event is evident at a temperature of ≈145 ◦C, which is accompanied by a  single event of sudden mass loss of 68%, representing violent combus- tion of the gel. This intense heat release occurs owing to the formation of  magnetite as a result of the decomposition of organic groups, brought  about by the strong combustion reaction of nitrate with citric acid, as  evidenced by the pronounced mass loss [43]. The same event was  observed for the sample with χ = 0.85. For the sample with χ = 0.85, two  exothermic events are apparent at temperatures of 148 and 285 ◦C,  corresponding to mass losses of 38 and 31%, respectively, for a total of  69% mass loss. For the sample with χ = 1.40, the first exothermic event  at ≈148 ◦C was not observed; only one endothermic event at 178 ◦C and  one exothermic event at 274 ◦C, with mass losses of 39 and 28%,  respectively (totalling 67%), were observed. The exothermic event present in the curves of the samples with χ = 0.85 and 1.40 at ≈280 ◦C is associated with the decomposition of the  remaining citric acid [47]. Some inferences can be drawn from the  thermal analyses. First, as χ increased from 0.3 to 0.85 and 1.4, there  was an increase in the citrate–nitrate autoignition temperature from 130  to a maximum of 300◦C, as well as a widening of the temperature range  where mass loss occurred. In this region two exothermic events can be  observed. The xerogel formed was mainly composed of iron complexes and  small amounts of residual water. When auto-ignition occurred, a large  amount of gas was released. The production of reducing gases, associ- ated with the intense release of heat, occurs owing to the favourable  formation of magnetite [43]. The production of these gases was simul- taneously monitored using two different techniques: TGA–FTIR (Fig. 2)  and TGA–MS (thermogravimetric analysis with coupled mass spectros- copy, Fig. 3). Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectra of the gases existing exactly  at the auto-ignition temperature (i.e., during the exothermic event) of  the xerogels from the syntheses using χ = 0.30, 0.85, and 1.40. In all  cases, the following peaks were expected: water vapour (H2O) in the  range of 3500–4000 cm−1 and 1740 cm−1; CO2, evidenced by the  accentuated band at 2360 cm−1; NO2, which absorbs in the region of  1368 cm−1; and CH4, which appears at ≈1200 cm−1. When auto-ignition  occurs, large amounts of these gases are released, accounting for the  water present during the synthesis, and the gases arising from the  decomposition of carbon- and nitrogen-containing compounds.

The inﬂuence of the combustion reaction ignition procedure, conventional heating and mi- crowave heating, on nanoparticles characteristics was investigated. The synthesized nanoparticles were charac- terized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry, magnetic measurements, speciﬁc surface area and adsorption-desorption iso- therms. The magnetic nanoparticles prepared by microwave heating exhibit larger speciﬁc surface area (70.7 m2/g), lower particle medium size (10.7 ± 3.09 nm) and lower saturation magnetization (41.8 emu/g) as com- pared to the sample prepared by conventional heating. Magnetic nanoparticles prepared by microwave heating were coated with oleic acid and Tween 80, and dispersed in phosphate buffered saline and distilled water. The colloidal suspensions demonstrated good stability, small polydispersity and small values of the hydrodynamic diameter, characteristics which recommend them to be tested for biomedical applications. © 2021 The Author(s).

XRD, thermal behavior and adsorption-desorption isotherms of magnetic nanopowders This work is focused on the preparation of magnetic iron oxides, that have the characteristics required in biomedical applications, by the so- lution combustion synthesis using conventional and microwave igni- tion respectively. Foremost, a comprehensive analysis of the iron oxide nanoparticles characteristics induced by the ignition of the com- bustion reactions using microwave and conventional ignition was per- formed. The synthesis conditions and structural characteristics of the nanopowders M1 and M2 are shown in Table 1. Manikandan et al. [49] have obtained Fe3O4 nanoparticles by microwave ignition of the solution combustion synthesis. They used Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, urea (CO(NH2)2) as fuel and a household microwave- oven operating at 850 W. Radpour et al. [55] studied the microwave- assisted solution combustion synthesis of Fe3O4 powders using ferric nitrate nonahydrate and citric acid as fuel in the presence of ammonia (NH4OH) solution. They have used a household microwave-oven oper- ating at 750 W. In our work we have used also ferric nitrate nonahydrate as oxidizer and citric acid as fuel but we propose a more simple experimental procedure without NH4OH and by using an equipment operating at 800 W which ensures the external elimination of the resulting gases during the reaction (Fig. 1-B). 3.1.1. XRD characterization The phase composition of the synthesized nanopowders (M1 and M2) was investigated by X-ray diffraction and the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 3. The phase composition of both M1 and M2 nanopowders presented in Table 1 was established by the PDXL2 software, based on the X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 3), using the RIR method. It can be noticed that the ignition procedure signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the phase composi- tion of the combustion reaction products. In case of sample M1 the main phase is magnetite (97%) alongside with maghemite (3%) while the main phase of sample M2 is maghemite (85%) alongside with mag- netite (11%), wüstite (2%) and Fe (2%). It can be also observed the sharper proﬁle of the diffraction peaks of sample M1 as compared to sample M2. This indicates that by the ignition of combustion reaction using a heating mantle (conventional heating) results a much better crystallized powder (M1) in comparison with the one prepared in microwave oven (M2). Another difference between the two samples is the average crystal- lite size of the major phase, (DXRD) calculated from the XRD pattern (Table 1). The mean crystallite size of sample M1 (23 nm), using a heating mantle, is more than 4 times larger compared to sample M2 (5 nm), prepared in microwave oven, which could be due to the higher temperature developed during the combustion reaction ignited in the heating mantle. Our results are consistent with the results reported by Manikandan et al. [49]. The characterization of the two types of magnetic nanoparticles M1 and M2 in terms of phase composition, demonstrated that the ignition of combustion reactions using conventional heating results in a much Fig. 2. Schematic protocol of stable colloidal suspensions preparation; M2 magnetic nanoparticles stabilized with OA/Tween 80, dispersed in distilled water (sample SM2-O/W; SM2-T/W) and PBS (sample SM2-O/PBS; SM2-T/PBS) respectively. A. Căpraru, E.-A. Moacă, C. Păcurariu et al. Powder Technology 394 (2021) 1026–1038 1029 better crystallized powder (M1) in comparison with the one prepared by microwave heating (M2). On the other hand, these results are in dis- agreement with the ones stated by Radpour et al. [53,55] who reported a little bit higher value of the crystallite size for the Fe3O4 particles prepared by microwave ignition as compared to that prepared by conventional ignition of the solution combustion reaction. The mean crystallite size of sample M2 is more suitable for biomedical applications, considering that the extremely small sizes of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (d < 4 nm) can be used as T1 magnetic resonance im- aging (MRI) contrast agents, whereas magnetic nanoparticles with size of 10 nm are more efﬁcient T2 MRI contrast agents [60]. This result conﬁrms that the reaction conditions and the equipment we have used for the mi- crowave ignition of the combustion reaction is appropriate to provide magnetic nanoparticles suitable for biomedical applications. The XRD results are in agreement with those obtained by Predescu et al. [61], who observed a single major intensity peak at 35.28° for mag- netite in dextran coated magnetite nanoparticles and with the data obtained by Yew et al. [62] and Basavegowda et al. [63]. 3.1.2. Thermal analysis The thermal behavior of samples M1 and M2 is shown in Fig. 4. The small endothermic effect on DSC curve at about 100 °C, accompanied by mass loss on TG curve of both powders is attributed to water evapora- tion in the samples. The DSC curves of both samples exhibit a large exo- thermic effect, between 150 and 450 °C for sample M1 and between 200 and 400 °C for sample M2. The exothermic effect of sample M1 is broader as compared to that of sample M2. This can be explained by the overlapping of two exothermic effects in case of sample M1-a weak one assigned to the oxidation of magnetite (which is the main phase in sample M1) to maghemite, accompanied by mass gain on TG curve (0.58%) and a stronger one assigned to the oxidative degradation of the organic residue resulting from the combustion reaction and ac- companied by mass loss on TG curve (2.94%). The TG curve of nanopowder M2 does not exhibit the mass increase between 200 and 400 °C which is in accordance with the presence of maghemite as main phase in this sample (Table 1). The exothermic ef- fect evidenced on the DSC curve of sample M2 is assigned to the oxida- tive degradation of the organic residue resulting from the combustion reaction. The mass loss of 9.19% on the TG curve of sample M2 is much higher compared to the 2.94% in case of sample M1 which dem- onstrates the higher content of organic residue in the sample M2 pre- pared in microwave oven. This organic residue creates a reducing at- mosphere in the system favoring the formation of low amount of FeO and Fe in case of sample M2, conﬁrmed by the phase composition (Table 1), which could explain the mass increase of 1.06% between 400 and 550 °C and attributed to the FeO and Fe oxidation. The small exothermic effect located around 500 °C may be assigned to the maghemite to hematite polymorph transformation. The TG-DSC results obtained by thermal analysis for both magnetic samples obtained by com-bustion reactions using microwave and con- ventional heating (Fig. 4) are in accordance with their phase composi- tion revealed by XRD analysis. As shown from XRD-RIR analysis, sample M1 has a high content of magnetite (Fe3O4). Many studies [64–66] demonstrated the high tendency of magnetite to oxidation in air at low temperatures. It has been proved [65,66] that, by heating in air, magnetite pass through two distinct stages characterized by exothermic effects: the ﬁrst stage (starting at about 200 °C) is due to the oxidation of magnetite to maghemite and the second one (starting at about 375 °C) to the polymorph transformation of maghemite to hematite. It has also been demonstrated that the thermal stability of magnetite depends mostly on the grain size, the rate of oxidation, and on the synthesis procedure [65,67]. The thermal behavior of M1 sample is in agreement with the literature reports presented above. The oxidation of magnetite to maghemite is evidenced by the mass gain on TG curve and the exothermic effect on DSC curve at about 250 °C, which overlaps with a much stronger effect at around 355 °C.

Fig. 4. TG/DSC curves of nanopowders M1 and M2. A. Căpraru, E.-A. Moacă, C. Păcurariu et al. Powder Technology 394 (2021) 1026–1038 1030 exothermic process, evidenced on DSC curve at 489 °C corresponds to the transition of maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) to hematite (α-Fe2O3) [68,69]. Unlike M1, the main phase of sample M2 is maghemite (85%) alongside with magnetite (11%), and minor amounts of wüstite (2%) and Fe (2%) (Table 1) such that the TG curve does not show the mass in- crease at about 200–250 °C. In the same time the strong exothermic ef- fect evidenced on DSC curve at 337.8 °C is less wide in comparison to that exhibited on DSC curve of sample M1 at 354.9 °C. In case of sample M2 can be observed the mass increase of 1.06% between 400 and 550 °C that can be attributed to the FeO and Fe oxidation. The exothermic effect evidenced on DSC curve at 475 °C, hides both the oxidation process of FeO and Fe as well as the polymorph transformation of maghemite to hematite. In accordance with the literature reports [47,70,71], the two strong exothermic effects on DSC curve of sample M1 (354.9 °C) and sample M2 (337.8 °C), are assigned to the combustion of the fuel resid- ual carbonaceous species. 3.1.3. Speciﬁc surface area and adsorption-desorption isotherms The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of nanopowders M1 and M2 are shown in Fig. 5. It can be observed the practically similar shape of the two isotherms (Fig. 5-A) which are of type II with H3 hysteresis loop, according to IUPAC classiﬁcation. Regarding the pore size distribution (Fig. 5-B), it can be noticed that both samples exhibit meso-pores. While nanopowder M2 shows only mesopores with diameters between 3 and 6 nm, in case of sample M1 alongside pores with diameters be- tween 3 and 4.5 can be also observed pores with diameter between 4.5 and 11 nm. These results are in accordance with the higher average pore diameter of sample M1 as compared with that of sample M2 (Table 1). It is important to notice (Table 1) the larger speciﬁc surface area of sample M2 (70.71 m2/g) as compared to that of sample M1 (41.53 m2/g). This result is in agreement with the smaller crystallite size of sample M2 obtained in the microwave oven by comparison to sample M1. The speciﬁc surface area represents an important characteristic of nanomaterials. High values of the speciﬁc surface area are essential for many uses of nanomaterials as adsorbents, catalysts as well in the bio- medical applications. It can be noticed (Table 1) that the ignition proce- dure of the combustion reactions considerably inﬂuenced the speciﬁc surface area of the samples. The speciﬁc surface area of sample M2 pre- pared by microwave ignition is much larger (SBET = 70.71 m2/g) as compared to that of sample M1 prepared by conventional ignition (SBET = 41.53 m2/g). This result is in agreement with the lower synthesis temperature conﬁrmed by the XRD analysis. In the case of conventional ignition, the speciﬁc surface area reported by us (SBET = 41.53 m2/g) and by Manikandan et al. [49] (SBET = 37.95 m2/g) are in good accordance but both are different to the one reported by Radpur et al. [55] (SBET = 71.50 m2/g) for the synthesis of Fe3O4. The high value of the speciﬁc surface area of sample M2, prepared by microwave ignition, recommends it for biomedical applications. 3.2. Magnetic properties evaluation According to the literature [49,71–73], many factors affect the mag- netic properties of materials such as phase composition, crystallinity, particle size and morphology, crystallite size as well as the carbon con- tent. The effect of the ignition procedure of the combustion reaction on the magnetic properties of the samples M1 and M2 is shown in Fig. 6. The hysteresis loops of the M1 and M2 nanopowders (Fig. 6), re- corded at room temperature evidence zero remanence and coercivity which prove the superparamagnetic behavior of both samples. By com- paring the saturation magnetization of the two samples, a higher value can be noticed in the case of sample M1 (66.6 emu/g) prepared in the heating mantle by conventional heating. The lower value of the satura- tion magnetization of sample M2 (41.8 emu/g), prepared in microwave oven, is expected considering the different phase composition (Table 1) and the higher content of non-magnetic organic residue. The lower value of the saturation magnetization of sample M2 (41.8 emu/g), prepared by microwave ignition, can be explained by the smaller size of maghemite particles, larger speciﬁc surface area and higher content of non-magnetic organic residue by comparison to sam- ple M1 (66.6 emu/g) prepared via conventional ignition.

Hence, functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have been used to ﬁll those gabs and are commonly used for metallic adsorption in contaminated waters. High sur- face to volume ratio of those MNPs allows for a larger capacity of pollutant adsorption. In this study, func- tionalized iron oxide MNPs are synthesized by a novel green approach using plant phytochemicals with the capability of absorbing multiple organic pollutants. Herein, we studied synthesis of iron oxide MNPs with crude plant extracts using a simple maceration technique. The reaction was supported further by heat treatments at the supercritical condition of ethanol to complete the reduction process to superpara- magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Our XRD result shows formation of spherical and cubic goethite (be- fore treatment-Y0PL), magnetite (after treatment -Y0PR) and magnetite (after treatment and functionalization-Y0PRP) with an average crystalline size 277, 29, 45 nm respectively. Phytochemicals increased the size and altered texture of nanoparticles. The magnetic properties were measured for mag- netization dependence on external magnetic ﬁeld to show superparamagnetic behavior with Ms = 44 (Hc = 123 Oe), 36 (Hc = 133 Oe) and 13 (Hc = 44 Oe) emu/g for Y0PR, Y0PRP and Y0PL, respectively. Absorption/reduction efﬁciency of nanoparticles was studied against MB (10–140 mg/L) and 4-NA (0.5–1 mM). ","Results and discussion 3.1. Structural and morphologic properties 3.1.1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) XRD measurements were carried out using a PANalytical X’Pert PRO XRD with Cu Ka radiation (k = 0.1548 nm). As seen in Fig. 2 (a), XRD peaks reveals the crystal structure of Geothite for Y0PL and Magnetite for Y0PR and Y0PRP. The average size was calculated using Scherer formula: D = Kk/bCos h as shown in Fig. 2(b) reveal- ing larger size for goethite iron oxide. This size increment is due to concentrated solution of crude extracts possesses as many as com- pounds for the solvent molecules used during extraction. Thus, the surface of nanoparticles is covered by a group of these compounds resulting in a signiﬁcant transformation of their sizes [10]. Bare and functionalized nanoparticles have comparable sizes because they are same phase nanoparticle except thin layers of surface compounds from plants during functionalization after they trans- formed to stable magnetic nanoparticles. 3.1.2. Scanning electronic microscope (SEM) The morphology of the samples has been investigated using Hitachi S-4800 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE- SEM) detector type XFlash 6|60 ex, equipped with EDX from Bruker Nano GmbH Berlin, Germany as shown in Fig. S1. As synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles display majority of spherical with a few of cubic particles with average size of 160 ± 60 nm (Fig. S2 (a-d)). When these particles were exposed to high pres- sure and temperature, the size was reduced to 100 ± 20 nm (Fig. S2 (e-l) with larger surface area but higher attractive force to the magnets. In the goethite (Y0PL) sample, surface modiﬁca- tion by plant extracts meaningfully affected their complete syn- thesis to magnetic particles, increased size and interaction. Plant phytochemicals are composed of large number of func- tional groups that would chelate the metallic nanoparticles eventually building strong shell that lessens the magnetic prop- erty and crystallographic presentation of particles blocking the electron beams in the SEM machine, hence blurry images. Sim- ple operation on SEM machine also serves as EDX, which pro- vides information related to elemental composition. Prominent peaks with Fe and O label are for iron and oxygen which are the primary elements in the synthesized samples, Fig. 1. Continuous single adsorbent Microﬂuidic chip design: a) 3D-model and b) image of the actual chip. Y.W. Getahun, J. Gardea-Torresdey, F.S. Manciu et al. Journal of Molecular Liquids 356 (2022) 118983 3 which indicates formation of iron oxide nanoparticles. Other peaks with different elements must have originated from the metal precursors and plant during synthesis or functionaliza- tion. Due to their magnetic nature, samples were attached on carbon tape before measurement. Due to that a peak for carbon is shown in the far left in all the EDX graphs (Fig. S2(c, g, k)). 3.1.3. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) The infrared transmission measurements were carried out between 400 and 4000 cm�1 with a vacuum based Bruker IFS 66v spectrometer, equipped with a DTGS detector and a KBr beam splitter. The samples for the IR studies were prepared in form of pellets by embedding the Goethite (Y0PL), Magnetite (Y0PR), and Magnetite (Y0PRP) nanoparticles in a transparent polycrystalline CsI matrix. An accumulation of 256 scans was performed for each spectrum. The data were normalized at each frequency to a vacuum throughput spectrum. In Fig. S3, the hydroxyl liberation and the changes in the Fe-O or O-H bonding associated with rearrangement of the oxygen close packing during thermal dihydroxylation from goethite (blue line spectrum) to magnetite (black and red line spectra) are observed. For example, the strong hydroxyl vibrations at 3392 cm�1 (stretching), 1629 cm�1 (bending), 1398 cm�1 (defor- mation), and 1070 cm�1 (deformation) almost disappear in the magnetite spectra of YOPR and YOPRP samples after heat treat- ment. The Fe-O bands at 687 and 501 cm�1 associated with a goethite structural conﬁguration transition to two vibrational modes of FeIII -O at 584 cm-1 and 402 cm-1 (see black spectrum of YOPR) that correspond to a magnetite structure. With nanoparticle functionalization, a downshift in the 584 cm�1 vibration to a value of 574 cm�1 and disappearance of the 402 cm-1 feature are also observed, demonstrating a further structural transformation. 3.2. Magnetic property A single step addition of extracts to metal precursors did not result in superparamagnetic nanoparticles that are needed for water treatment application at room temperature. Hence, support- ing the reaction by heat treatment at the supercritical condition of liquid was necessary. A portion of these particles was thus heated in pressurized environment. All nanoparticles were attracted to the permanent magnet showing magnetic behavior and their magnetic properties was characterized in vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) at 300 K and 50 k. During the heat treatment process, the temperature was 250 �C where the magnetic phase structure of Fe3O4 nanoparticles are formed, it is unlikely plant phytochemical will exist in their natural form. Thus, particles were immersed in extract solution and functionalized over 12 h period at room tem- perature while stirring at 850 rpm. Similarly, these particles were washed and dried to be analyzed in the powder form by the VSM. As shown in Fig. 3, the magnetization dependence on exter- nal magnetic ﬁeld was recorded at 300 and 50 K revealing superparamagnetic-like behavior for all the samples. The satura- tion magnetization (Ms) and the coercivity (Hc) of both heat- treated nanoparticles (Y0PR) and functionalized after heat treat- ment (Y0PRP) with 44 and 36 emu/g and 123, 133 Oe respectively have been more than adequate for the intended application which, was possible to easily manipulate the particles in water by a phys- ical magnet as less as 0.5 Tesla. However, magnetic property of functionalized nanoparticles was lower by about 8 emu/g com- pared to bare counterparts. It is important to note that the ﬁrst plant-based nanoparticle (Y0PL) has Ms = 13 emu/g and Hc = 44 Oe, which is not feasible for water treatment and hyperthermia or other applications [12]. 3.3. Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–VIS) Iron nanoparticles typically display maximum absorbance (k max) between 300 and 450, which is also shown on the nanopar- ticles synthesized in the present study (Fig. 4(a, b)). The difference between Y0PR and Y0PRP is in the surface property since the latter is modiﬁed by plant phytochemicals. Thus, both Y0PR and Y0PRP have similar absorbance maxima. Similarly, Y0PL has identical k max but narrow peak. Since all samples were measured at the same scan rate, the peak broadening could have been caused by distortion of the electrons while colliding at extreme conditions in the pressure reactor [19]. The bandgap analysis of the samples were determined from Fig. (4b) revealing 3.17, 2.57, and 2. 78 eV for Y0PL, Y0PR, and Y0PRP respectively as shown in Fig. S4. 3.4. Absorption efﬁciency of nanoparticles towards organic pollutants 3.4.1. Disperison Dispersion of nanoparticles in aqueous medium enable effective interaction with pollutants in water. Non– functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles are believed to weakly disperse pertinent to metal surface with no binding sites, lacking afﬁnity to water. Good dispersion is also a measure of successful surface modiﬁcation. In the case of the present magnetic particles, functionalized nanopar- ticles stood comparatively well dispersed after they were sonicated for 1 h and allowed to stand for another hour. An important ﬁnding worth mentioning here is as synthesized nanoparticles (Fig. 5 III) were highly dispersed for more than 72 h even after the dispersion. Simultaneous reduction and coating tend to form stable nanoparti- cles allowing functional groups to grow on the surface during syn- thesis than attaching on previously stabilized nanoparticles because the attachment is stronger. Nevertheless, their weak mag- netic properties would have also signiﬁcant contribution in pre- venting their aggregation. 30 40 50 60 70 (232) (-228) (220) (-114) (-114) (220) (-228) (232) (1511) (041) (130) Intensity (a.u) 2θ (ο) Y0PL Y0PR Y0PRP (120) Material  Crystalline  size  (Av.) in (nm) Phase structures  Y0PR 29 Fe3O4- magnetite  Y0PRP 45 Fe3O4- magnetite Y0PL 277 α-FeOOH- goethite  (a) (b) Fig. 2.

Absorption efﬁcacy of nanoparticles towards methylene blue The graphs in Fig. 6 represent outputs from absorption experi- ments of nanoparticles (5 mg/L) added as powders against methy- lene blue solution at different concentrations (10 to 140 mg/L) and times (5 to 160 min) without addition of catalysts. The absorption spectra for MB at different concentrations can be found in the sup- plementary material (Fig. S5) Despite its weak magnetic properties, Y0PL showed super performance at all concentrations with above 85% removal efﬁciency in time less than 20 min. Same amount of adsorbent removed a wide range of concentrations of methylene blue from polluted water. As shown in Fig. 6(a-f) and Fig. (S6), all nanoparticles have high rate of adsorption at their optimum adsorbate concentrations. Both high magnetic samples also showed comparable efﬁciency for removal of methylene blue at 10 mg/L concentration. However, above this concentration, Y0PL has better efﬁciency than both bare and functionalized nanoparti- cles. Y0PR and Y0PRP have comparable small size hence higher sur- face area, an important factor in absorption mechanism of particles. However, less hydrophilic surfaces prevent them from excellent dispersion in water. This further limits their interaction with pollutants in water at reasonable appropriate time. Even though Y0PRP is functionalized with same solution of extracts, the interaction of the phytochemicals and the nanoparticles should be inadequate due to lack of functional surface on nanoparticles from the pressure reactor. The adsorption of methylene blue on to sample adsorbent fol- lows Langmuir isotherm. Moreover, calculation of separation factor (RL) by the formula (4) gives 0.798.

One example is the magnetic  nanoparticle-based hyperthermia, where the magnetic nanoparticles absorbed by the tumor cells are subjected to  alternating magnetic field to generate local heating. Other applications rely on the effect of static magnetic fields  to collect or rearrange cells, which are covered with magnetic nanoparticle containing substrates. In both cases,  the effect of clustering largely modifies the magnetic properties of these materials. In the present study, we have  examined the commercially available multicomponent material, NanoShuttle™-PL (Greiner Bio-One) particles  composed of gold, iron oxide and poly-L-lysine, which are used for the creation of levitated 3D cell cultures. While this material is often used for cell culture studies, there is no available data on its magnetic and structural  properties. The aim of the study was to understand the magnetic properties of this composite material based on  the characterisation of the size distribution and clustering of the magnetic nanoparticles. We have performed  RAMAN, AFM/MFM measurements and SEM/STEM investigation of the composite material. Magnetic properties  were investigated with a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) both in the liquid state and in the surface  extracted form. 1. ","Thus, the use of these nanoparticles results a better  combination of radiotherapy and hyperthermia. From the point of view  of material science, the magnetic behavior of the clusters of magnetic  particle systems is also very active research field both in their theoretical  and experimental aspects, and thus the NanoShuttle™-PL liquid can be a  good reference material for such studies. In the present article, we determined the material composition and  the particle size distribution of the NanoShuttle™-PL sample, and  examined its magnetic properties. These are essential for the physical  characterisation of the sample and the latter experimental applications. 2. Experimental  For SEM/STEM and Raman measurements, the sample was prepared  as follows. The nanoparticles in the sample were in an oily medium. The  carrier was dissolved in alcohol. Mixing was performed by ultrasound  equipment. In the process, a magnet held the nanoparticles together. After mixing, the oil precipitated on top of the liquid. This has been  removed from the liquid. This process was repeated four times. The VSM measurements were performed first with the original liquid  dispersed sample. For the measurements, the liquid had to be removed  to examine the sample in the solid state. This was achieved by localizing  the nanoparticles deposited in the sample holder with a permanent  magnet and pouring out the liquid. After drying in air for 24 h, the  remaining liquid was evaporated. The Raman spectroscopy and the AFM/MFM measurements were  performed with a Horiba LabRam nano instrument. For the MFM mea- surements “two pass scanning” [15] method was used. Firstly, the tip  scans the sample topology in the tapping mode. Secondly the magnetic  structure is determined. Raman spectroscopy has been used to identify chemical and bio- logical molecules by their Raman spectra [16]. With this equipment, the  exact material composition can be determined. The alcohol dissolved  particles were put a microscope slide and the Raman measurements  were performed on different clusters located under the optical micro- scope. During the work, 633 nm laser was used as excitation source and  the measurement time was 30 s. The excitation beam was focused onto  the sample surface with a 50x lens. The beam intensity was 0.21 mW  which is 3.2% of the maximum intensity. The microstructure and composition of the sample was studied by a  Thermo Fisher Scientific-scios 2 instrument SEM and STEM microscope. This instrument was supplemented with energy-dispersive x-ray spec- troscopy (EDX) to provide information on the spatial distribution in an  area of the material. The magnetization curves were recorded with a home-built vibrating  sample magnetometer (VSM) [17]. With this instrument, the magneti- zation curves of the sample can be recorded. An electromagnetic vi- bration system provides sinusoidal motion to the sample. The sample  performs this motion in the magnetic field produced by the excitation  coils. As a result, a voltage is induced in a measuring coil, from which the  magnetic moment of the sample can be determined. 3. Results and discussions  3.1. Raman spectroscopy  The Raman spectrum (Fig.1) shows that the sample contains poly-L-  lysine and iron-oxide as reported by the manufacturer. The iron-oxide is  in maghemite form, there are many peaks. Surprisingly, also nickel-  oxide was identified. The gold has no Raman activity because of crys- tal symmetry. The peaks at 2018 1/cm and 2225 1/ cm are not true  peaks but indicate background. The 2923 1/cm is the solvent peak and  belongs to the C–H stretching region (2800–3100 1/cm) [18]. Fig.1. Raman spectrum of the sample. Three ingredients have been identified: nickel-oxide, maghemite and poly-L-lysine. The 2923 1/cm is the solvent peak and  belongs to the C–H stretching region. V. V´ekony et al. Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 545 (2022) 168772 3 The following peaks (Table 1) were identified based on the literature. The numbers in parenthesis are the literature data. The nickel-oxide (red) peaks are the follows [19–21]: one phonon  excitation: 586 1/cm (560) (1 longitudinal phonon mode); two phonon  excitations: 724 1/cm (740) (2 transversal optical phonon modes), 922  1/cm (925) (1 transversal optical and 1 longitudinal optical phonon  modes), 1069 1/cm (1100) (2 longitudinal optical phonon modes); two  magnon band: 1482 1/cm (1500). Based on [22–24] our sample contains maghemite (blue). The  maghemite peaks: 341 1/cm (365, 350, 350), 509 1/cm (511, 512, 500),  672 1/cm (700, 665, 700) (longitudinal optical mode). There are many  peaks in this part of the spectrum, there is a lot of overlap. As particle  size decreases, these lines become broader, shifting towards lower  wavenumbers. The wide size distribution is the reason of the difference  between the bulk material and our sample. The poly-L-lysine (green) peaks are the follows [25–27]: the AmIII  region (C −N strechting coupled with N −H bending): 1211 1/cm (1218)  (β-turn), 1267 1/cm (1253/1267, 1245) (α-helix and π-bulge/helix),  1301 1/cm (1296, 1296), 1340 1/cm (1332, 1316), the Cα −H (bending)  peak: 1403 1/cm (1395, 1396), the AmII peak (C −N strechting coupled  with N −H bending): 1560 1/cm (1560, 1564) and the AmI peak (C = O  strechting vibration): 1688 1/cm (1665, 1670). 3.2. SEM, STEM, EDX measurements  During the EDX measurement, the sample was scanned at 1100 nm  while providing information on the material composition. Fig. 2 shows  that there are 3 metallic materials in the sample. The larger ellipsoidal  shape particles are the gold particles. The other two materials are iron  and nickel.

Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 545 (2022) 168772 4 Typical TEM and STEM micrographs of the nanoparticles are pre- sented in Fig. 3. Particle size distribution in NanoShuttle™-PL was  estimated from the TEM and STEM image analysis by using the ImageJ  and Origin software. The analysis was performed on each image. A large  number of particles of different sizes were selected and measured in the  ImageJ. The resulting data set was processed in the Origin. Particles  were classified in 5 nm increments in the recorded histogram. A curve  corresponding to a lognormal distribution was fitted to this. The histograms of the particle size distribution are presented in  Fig. 4. The fitting function was the lognormal distribution:  f(d, μ, σ) = A dσ ̅̅̅̅̅ 2π √ e−(lnd−lnμ)2 2σ2   where A is a fitting parameter, d is the diameter, σ and lnμ are the  standard deviation and the mean of the variable’s natural logarithm. We  have obtained the following values for these based on the fitting: A = 6042 ± 90, σ = 0.55 ± 0.01, lnμ = 3.40 ± 0.05. The corresponding  average nanoparticle size is μ = 30 nm. Fig. 3. TEM (top) and STEM (bottom) images of the iron-oxide nanoparticles and gold particles embed in a polymer matrix. The clustering tendency of the magnetic  nanoparticles can be clearly seen. Fig.4. The size distribution of the nanoparticles in the four images (the “box  size” is 5 nm). The fitted curve corresponds to the lognormal distribution. Fig.5. The microstructure of the polymer particles aggregated on the surface of  Si under the effect of external magnetic field. V. V´ekony et al. Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 545 (2022) 168772 5 Based on the electron microscopy observations we can conclude, that  the magnetic particles and the gold particles are dispersed in the poly- mer matrix “flakes”. These polymer matrix particles are aggregated in a  magnetic field or on the substrate into larger clusters with an open  structure (Fig. 5). 3.3. AFM and MFM measurements  The AFM and MFM images are shown in the Fig. 6. There is a clear  correspondence for some particles on the topographic image and the  magnetic information of the lift-mode phase shift image. Dark contrast  means attraction, white contrast close to a dark contrast means repul- sion. The AFM topography has a lower resolution than the STEM images,  so it is difficult to identify the different components.

S4_00006.pdf,Improvement of the saturation magnetization of PEG coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles,"Improvement of the saturation magnetization of PEG coated  superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles  Oznur Karaagac *, Hakan K¨oçkar  Physics Department, Science & Literature Faculty, Balikesir University, 10145, Cagis, Balikesir, Turkey    A R T I C L E  I N F O    Keywords:  Iron oxide nanoparticles  PEG coating  Superparamagnetism  Saturation magnetization  A B S T R A C T    Polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated iron oxide nanoparticles are of interest because of their distinctive properties  and potential applications such as magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic hyperthermia and drug delivery. In  this study, PEG coated iron oxide nanoparticles were obtained by a two-step synthesis route including copre- cipitation and coating. Different amounts of PEG6000 were used for coating and the effect of PEG amount on the  structural and magnetic properties of the nanoparticles was investigated. Crystal structure, surface coating and  particle size of the nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction technique, Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The particle size of iron oxide nanoparticles remained  almost constant (7–8 nm) with the increase of PEG amount. It was determined from thermogravimetric analysis  that the coating percentage of the nanoparticles steadily increased from 2.6 to 6.9 % with the increase of PEG  amount from 5 to 15 g. Magnetic properties of the nanoparticles were studied by vibrating sample magnetometer  and all samples were found to be superparamagnetic. PEG coated iron oxide nanoparticles showed higher  saturation magnetization, Ms values than the uncoated iron oxide nanoparticles. Also, Ms of the coated nano- particles increased with the increase of PEG coating and reached a value of 62.4 emu/g showing an increase of 19  % over uncoated iron oxide nanoparticles while maintaining the superparamagnetic behavior. This remarkable  rise in the Ms of PEG coated iron oxide nanoparticles may improve the control and delivery of the nanoparticles  for potential applications. 1. ","The results are consistent with the aim of preserving the mag- netic core size. Magnetic core size of the PEG coated nanoparticles was  found to be around 7 nm and remained almost unchanged with the in- crease of PEG amount used in the coating step. Characterizations of PEG  coated iron oxide nanoparticles were made by X-ray diffraction, Fourier  transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, trans- mission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and  vibrating sample magnetometry. It was observed that the nanoparticles  were successfully coated and magnetic characterization of the nano- particles showed that the Ms of PEG coated iron oxide nanoparticles was  higher than the Ms of uncoated iron oxide nanoparticles while the  magnetic core size and superparamagnetic behavior were preserved. Despite the non-magnetic character of coating, Ms of PEG coated  nanoparticles was observed to be increasing with the increase of coating  percentage. Effective coating with an improvement of Ms may make a  contribution to the properties of PEG coated magnetic nanoparticles and  provide a better control over the delivery of nanoparticles for potential  applications. 2. Experimental  2.1. Chemicals  Ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3⋅6H2O, ≥ 98%, Sigma-Aldrich),  ferrous chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2⋅4H2O, ≥ 99%, Merck), ammo- nium hydroxide (NH4OH, 25%, Sigma-Aldrich) and polyethylene glycol  (PEG with average molecular weight of 6000 Da, Sigma-Aldrich) were  used to synthesize PEG coated iron oxide nanoparticles. All chemicals  were used without purification. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ.cm) was used  in all syntheses. 2.2. Synthesis of PEG coated iron oxide nanoparticles  PEG coated iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by copreci- pitation. Molar ratio of Fe2+:Fe3+ = 1:2 was used to obtain iron ion salt  solution. First, 0.25 g FeCl2⋅4H2O and 0.68 g of FeCl3⋅6H2O were dis- solved together in 25 ml deionized water by stirring under nitrogen  atmosphere in order to obtain iron ion solution. Then, 25 ml of NH4OH  (25%) was poured at once to this solution under vigorous stirring and  nitrogen atmosphere. The suspension was stirred for 30 min at room  temperature and uncoated iron oxide nanoparticles (core nanoparticles)  were obtained. After the synthesis, the precipitate was washed three  times and supernatant was decanted. After that, core nanoparticles were  dispersed in distilled water for the coating step. Varying amounts of PEG  (5–25 g) were dissolved in distilled water and added to the core nano- particles under vigorous stirring. The stirring was continued for 60 min  under nitrogen atmosphere. After the reaction, the coated iron oxide  nanoparticles were precipitated by a magnet and washed several times  in order to remove the excess polymer. The samples were labelled ac- cording to the amounts of PEG used for the synthesis (5, 10, 15 and 25 g)  as P5, P10, P15 and P25, respectively (see Table 1). Besides, another  sample, named P15-2, was synthesized by adding one further step to the  synthesis procedure. An ultra-sonification step was added before the  coating step in order to investigate the effect of the dispersion of un- coated nanoparticles on the properties of PEG coated iron oxide nano- particles. In the synthesis of sample P15-2, uncoated iron oxide  nanoparticles were ultrasonicated for 15 min before the coating step. The coating step of P15-2 was the same as sample P15. The uncoated  iron oxide nanoparticles (core nanoparticles) were labelled as P0. All  samples were obtained in dispersion and powder forms for the charac- terizations. For dispersion, coated iron oxide nanoparticles were diluted  with distilled water and kept for the characterizations. For uncoated iron  oxide nanoparticles dispersion was prepared according to the method  used by Massart in [30]. For powder form, the samples were dried in an  oven at 50 ◦C for overnight. 2.3. Characterization techniques  Crystal structure of the nanoparticles was investigated by using X-ray  diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X’Pert PRO) technique. The scan was  performed between 2θ = 20-80◦ by using CuKα (λ = 0.15406 nm) ra- diation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Perkin Elmer  Spectrum Two) was used to identify the coating of the nanoparticles. Analysis was made by using KBr pellets and the scan was performed  between 400 and 4000 cm−1. The amount of PEG coating on the  nanoparticles were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA,  Setaram, Labsys EVO) with a 10 ◦C/min heating rate under argon at- mosphere (50 ml/min). The measurements were performed from 30 to  800 ◦C. Particle sizes were determined from the transmission electron  microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30 Super Twin Microscope) images. Dispersions of the nanoparticles were obtained according to the pro- cedures in Section 2.2 and used for TEM analysis. A drop of diluted  dispersion was placed onto carbon film coated copper grid and allowed  to air dry before the imaging. The size of the nanoparticles was calcu- lated by using Image-J software. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy  (EDX) which is integrated into TEM was also used for elemental analysis. Magnetic measurements were made by using vibrating sample magne- tometer (VSM, ADE EV9) at room temperature between −20 kOe and + 20 kOe with 1 Oe intervals. 3. Results AND DISCUSSION  XRD patterns of PEG coated nanoparticles (P5, P10, P15, P15-2 and  P25) were given in Fig. 1. As can be seen in the patterns, all samples  show characteristic peaks at around 2θ = 31◦, 35◦, 43◦, 53◦, 57◦ and 63◦ which correspond to (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440)  planes of cubic spinel structure of iron oxide, respectively (JCPDS cards  no. 019–0629 and 039–1346). Average crystallite size of the PEG coated  iron oxide nanoparticles, dXRD was estimated by using Scherrer  equation:  d = κλ Bcos(θ) (1)   where K is Scherrer constant, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, B is the  full width of half maximum (FWHM) of the corresponding peak and θ is  Bragg angle [31]. Scherrer constant depends on the determination of the  width of the peak, shape of crystal and the size distribution [32]. Crystallite size of the nanoparticles was estimated for the most intense  O.

Average crystallite sizes of the samples (P5-P25) were found to  be around 7 nm which is similar to the size of uncoated iron oxide  nanoparticles. And, dXRD of PEG coated iron oxide nanoparticles were  given in Table 1. The change in the size is rather little. Thus, dXRD of PEG  coated iron oxide nanoparticles was concluded to be unaffected by the  amount of PEG used for the synthesis unlike other studies stating a  decrease in the size of the nanoparticles with PEG coating for both in situ  [19,21] and two-step [20] synthesis. In [19], crystallite size decreases  from 14.96 to 10.85 nm with the increase of PEG amount. In [21],  crystallite size of uncoated iron oxide nanoparticles is 13.6 nm whereas  the size of coated nanoparticles varies between 9.3 and 12.3 nm. Also, in  the two-step coprecipitation [20], the crystallite size of uncoated iron  oxide nanoparticles decreases from 12 to 8.6 nm with PEG coating. The  amount of PEG used in our study is quite high compared to this work. The supersaturated medium due to high amount of PEG may have pre- served the particle size of core nanoparticles. In our study, dXRD of PEG  coated iron oxide nanoparticles is almost same with the uncoated  nanoparticles. And, dXRD of sample P15-2 (7.2 nm) is similar to the  uncoated sample indicating that the crystal structure and particle size of  the nanoparticles remain unchanged in the synthesis with additional  dispersion step. It can be concluded from the XRD analysis that all PEG  coated iron oxide nanoparticles maintain the crystal structure and  crystallite size. In order to confirm the PEG coating of the nanoparticles, FTIR  analysis was performed. Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectrum of iron oxide  nanoparticles without coating (P0), iron oxide nanoparticles with PEG  coating (P5, P10, P15, P15-2 and P25) and PEG6000. In the spectrum of  all coated iron oxide nanoparticles the characteristic peak at around 570  cm−1 indicates the Fe-O bond in iron oxide [33]. The peaks around 950  and 1080 cm−1 and a wider band around 1300 cm−1 confirm the exis- tence of PEG coating on iron oxide nanoparticles. The peak at ~ 950  cm−1 corresponds to the –CH– out of plane bending vibration and the  peaks at ~ 1100 and ~ 1300 cm−1 are assigned to C-O-C symmetric and  asymmetric stretching vibrations, respectively [34]. The bands at  around 1600 and 3400 cm−1 in the spectra of uncoated and coated iron  oxide nanoparticles originate from the vibrations of hydroxyl groups  connected to the surface as indicated in many studies [19–21,35]. A  small shift of Fe-O peak to higher wavenumbers was observed in com- parison with uncoated nanoparticles. This shift may indicate the change  of environment of magnetic core after PEG coating due to the bonds  between iron oxide core and PEG coating as in [35–37]. It can be  concluded that iron oxide nanoparticles were successfully coated by  PEG. The mentioned peaks became clear with the increase of PEG  amount from 5 to 25 g. Sample P15-2 also had the peaks related to the  PEG coating. In order to determine the coating percentage, thermogravimetric  analysis was performed.

The curves were plotted in 50–800 ◦C region. Uncoated  iron oxide nanoparticles show a small (3.5%) mass loss upon heating to  800 ◦C due to the removal of adsorbed physical and chemical water at  lower temperatures and phase change of iron oxide (from γ-Fe2O3 to  α-Fe2O3) at higher temperatures (see Fig. 3b). The degradation process  of PEG6000 can also be seen from Fig. 3c. In the TG curves of PEG coated  iron oxide nanoparticles in Fig. 3a, degradation starts around 150 ◦C and  continues to around 440 ◦C due to the loss of PEG coating on the  nanoparticle surface. This temperature range may change according to  the amount of PEG coating. The mass loss of PEG coated iron oxide  nanoparticles over a temperature range of 150–440 ◦C is due to  desorption and subsequent evaporation of PEG [21,28]. The mass loss  due to the PEG coating increases from 2.6 to 6.9 % as the PEG amount  increases from 5 to 15 g. The coating percentage slightly reduces to 6.3  % as the PEG amount continues to increase through 25 g. The coating  percentages of the nanoparticles were listed in Table 1. In the case of  sample P15-2, the mass loss is 6.1% which is slightly lesser than that of  P15.

The  morphological analysis had been carried out to obtain the particle size of the synthesized nanoparticles. The  magnetic studies revealed the superparamagnetic nature of the ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles, and the maximum  magnetization of 30 emu/g for the Zn0.2N0.8Fe2O4 sample. The M − H curves were fitted with the Langevin  function to obtain the magnetic particle diameter of ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles. The electrical conduction in  ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles was explained through the Verway hopping mechanism. The Zn0.2N0.8Fe2O4  nanoparticle exhibited a higher electrical conductivity of 42 μS/cm and surface charge of −29/7 mV due to the  enhanced hopping of Fe3+ ions in the octahedral sites. Owing to this nature, they were identified as the suitable  candidates in the applications such as thermoelectrics, hyperthermia, magnetic coating and for the preparation of  conducting ferrofluids. 1. Introduction  A group of materials called Spinel ferrites, MFe2O4 (M2+ = Zn2+,  Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Cd2+) are significant due to their enhanced optical,  magnetic, and electrical properties, which find various applications  [1–7]. ","The doping of Zn in NiFe2O4 causes an expansion of crystal  lattice due to the larger ionic radius of Zn than Ni (0.72 Å) ion which  results in the shift of diffraction planes towards the lower angle as shown  in Fig. 2 (b). The lattice parameter (aexpt) is calculated using the  following equation [16].where and (hkl) are the interplanar distance  and miller indices, respectively. According to the Vegard’s law, unit cell  parameters should vary linearly with composition for a continuous  substitution of solid in which atoms or ions that substitutes each other. Fig. 2(c) shows the plot of lattice parameter of ZnxNi1-xFe2O4 nano- particles versus dopant concentration. An increasing trend of lattice  parameter with respect to dopant concentration is observed as the lattice  constant of Zn is higher than Ni, which shows that it obeys Vegard’s law  and the variation is attributed to the expansion of crystal lattice with  respect to zinc doping. The following equations are used to find the lattice parameter of the  spinel ferrites theoretically [17–20].where Ro is the ionic radius of ox- ygen (0.138 nm). The synthesized ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles exhibit an inverse  spinel structure with the cationic distribution . The ionic radii (rA and rB)  of (A) and [B] sites are calculated using the formulae, respectively,  where r(Zn2+), r(Fe3+) and r(Ni2+) are the ionic radii of Zn2+(0.83 Å),  Fe3+(0.67 Å) and Ni2+ (0.74 Å), respectively and CA(Zn), are the con- centrations of Zn2+ and Fe3+ ions on (A) sites and Ni2+ and Fe3+ ions on  [B] sites, respectively. The theoretical lattice parameter is shown in Table 1, which is found  to match with the values calculated from the experimental details ob- tained through XRD. The average crystallite size and density of ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nano- particles are calculated using Debye Scherer formula [21–23]and are  listed in Table 1. The doping of zinc in nickel ferrite enhances the grain  growth and results in an increased crystallite size with respect to dopant  concentration. The X-ray density ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles de- creases on addition of Zn in ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles due to the  variation in molecular weight and lattice parameter. 3.2. Morphological and compositional analysis of ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4  nanoparticles  The FE-SEM micrographs of PN0, PN2 and PN4 samples show the  images of agglomerated nanoparticles (Fig. 3). The synthesized nano- particles interact magnetically among each other which leads to the  agglomeration. PN0, PN2 and PN4 nanoparticles are found to be spherical with the  average grain size in the range of 15–20 nm, 20–24 nm and 23–30 nm,  respectively. Furthermore, TEM analysis has been done to further  examine the particle size of nanoparticles with high resolution. Fig. 4 shows the TEM micrographs and particle size distribution  graphs of PN0, PN2 and PN4, which indicates that the synthesized  nanoparticles are spherical in shape. The particle size of 17, 20 and 25  nm is observed for FN0, FN3 and FN4 samples, respectively, which is  found to match well with the values obtained using Debye Scherer  equation. Table 2 sows the atomic percentage of all the elements in ZnxNi1-  xFe2O4 nanoparticles. The Zn peak gets more intense with the increase in  dopant concentration as shown in Fig. 5. Also, Zn/Ni ratio is increasing with respect to the dopant concen- tration and the values are found to match with the calculated ratio of x/  (1-x) in ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4. These observations clearly substantiate the  appropriate quantity of Zn doping in NiFe2O4 nanoparticles and proves  the efficiency of synthesis. 3.3. Magnetic studies of ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles  The ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles exhibit nearly zero remanence  and zero coercivity as shown in Fig. 6 suggesting the superparamagnetic  behavior of synthesized nanoparticles. The critical size of ZnxNi(1-  x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles for monodomain formation is found to be 40 nm,  Fig. 1. Synthesis procedure of ZnxNi1-xFe2O4 nanoparticles. K. Anu and J. Hemalatha                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Ceramics International 48 (2022) 3417–3425 3419 which is comparable to the values reported by Iglesias et al. (2019) [24]. As the particle size of the synthesized ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles  is smaller than the critical size, the thermal energy is large enough to  randomize the magnetic moments in the particle leading to zero net  magnetization at zero field and favors superparamagnetism [1,25,26]  When the external field is applied, the magnetic moment of the atoms  has a tendency to align in the magnetic field direction which leads to  higher magnetization. The M − H curves of ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles are fitted with the  Langevin function [27,28] as shown in Fig. 7 and then log normal dis- tribution (Fig. 8) is used to find the average particle size of the nano- particles [29–31]. The magnetic particle diameters obtained from log-normal distri- bution are 16.5, 17.8, 20.2, 23.2 and 24.5 nm for FN0, FN1, FN2, FN3  and FN4, respectively. These values are found to match with those ob- tained from TEM micrographs as shown in Table 3. The magnetization of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles is obtained as 19 emu/g  which is higher than the value of 12 emu/g reported by Nabiyouni et al. (2010) and less than the bulk magnetization of 55 emu/g for the  NiFe2O4 [2]. This is due to strong surface effect and reduced number of  magnetic moments which are the consequences of reduced particle size. From Table 4, it is observed that the saturation magnetization of  ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles enhances until the Zn concentration rea- ches x = 0.2 and decreases afterwards, which is similar to the obser- vations reported by Hedaoo et al. [32]. In the undoped NiFe2O4  nanoparticles, equal number of Fe3+ ions occupy both the (A) and [B]  Fig. 2.

Hence,  the overall magnetic moment is contributed by the Ni2+ ion in [B] site  [5]. While doping, the Ni2+ ions are replaced with diamagnetic Zn2+ ions which have a preferential occupancy in (A) site of the cubic lattice  that leads to the movement of same number of Fe3+ ions from (A) site to  [B] site. This cationic distribution leads to an enhanced magnetization  value until the dopant concentration reaches the critical value of x = 0.2. Above x = 0.2, the additional number of Zn2+ ion moves same number of  Fe3+ ions from (A) site to [B] site but arranged in an antiparallel manner  with respect to the neighbor ion due to the dominance of superexchange  interaction than the double exchange interaction in [B] site [3,33]. Thus, the reduction in magnetization is observed in ZnxNi1-xFe2O4  nanoparticles for x > 0.2. Hence, the Zn concentration of x = 0.2 in ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 is  Fig. 4.

Electrical conductivity studies on ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles  A linear increase in current with an increasing voltage as shown in  Fig. 9 (a) shows that the ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles are Ohmic in  nature. From the V–I measurements, the electrical resistance offered by  ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles is calculated and used for computing the  electrical conductivity of ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles. The electrical  conductivity of undoped NiFe2O4 nanoparticles is found to be 10 μS/cm,  which is higher than the value of 3.2 μS/cm reported by Chandamma  et al. (2017). The electrical conduction in ZnxNi1-xFe2O4 nanoparticles can be  explained using Verway hopping mechanism [9]. According to that, the  hopping of electrons and holes between same atoms of different valence  states contributes to the electrical conduction in ZnxNi1-xFe2O4  Fig. 5. EDS Spectra of ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles. Fig. 6. M − H plots of ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles. Fig. 7. M − H plots of ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles fitted with the Lange- vin function. K. Anu and J. Hemalatha                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Ceramics International 48 (2022) 3417–3425 3422 nanoparticles. The A-A and B–B site have higher hopping length than the  A-B site of the spinel ferrites and hence, the hopping is highly possible in  A-A and B–B site [34]. Among them, the hopping of ions are apparent in  [B] site as it holds both the Ni2+ and Fe3+ ions instead of Fe3+ ions alone  as in (A) site. The formation of Ni3+ and Fe2+ ions in [B] site for hopping  is represented as below   Ni2+ → Ni3++ e-                                                                                     Fe3++ e− → Fe2+ The Ni2+ ion present in [B] site creates a hole vacancy by ejecting an  electron and results in the formation of Ni3+ ion. The Fe3+ ion takes up  the ejected electron in the octahedral site and forms Fe2+ valance state. Now, the hopping takes place between the Fe3+ - Fe2+ and Ni2+ - Ni3+ ions in [B] sites which leads to an electrical conduction [34,35] in  ZnxNi1-xFe2O4 nanoparticles. The inclusion of Zn enhances the electrical conductivity of ZnxNi1-  xFe2O4 nanoparticles up to the critical dopant concentration (x = 0.2)  and decreases afterwards as shown in Fig. 9 (b). This is attributed to the  increase in hopping probability of Fe3+ ions due to an increase in  number of Fe3+ ions in the octahedral site of spinel ferrites on doping of  Zn up to the critical concentration as discussed in section 3.3. Hence, the  PN2 nanoparticles show higher conductivity of 41 μS/cm, which is  higher than the value reported by Chandamma et al. (2017). Further  doping of Zn reduces the number of Fe3+ ions in octahedral site due to  their antiparallel arrangement for maintaining the charge neutrality,  which in turn affects the hopping probability and results in reduced  electrical conductivity. 3.5. Surface charge studies on ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles{write as in  the heading}  The surface charge properties of ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nanoparticles are  analyzed through the zeta potential values which are shown in Fig. 10. Table 5 shows that the surface charge of ZnxNi(1-x)Fe2O4 nano- particles is negative with an increasing trend up to the critical dopant  concentration of x = 0.2, after which the surface charge declines.

Photolysis does not result in particle growth per se. Photolysis causes extensive diﬀusion of the precursor, which leads to a high surface coverage in the outer volumes of the glass and the formation of small, 6 1 nm in diameter particles consisting of an elemental iron core with an Fe2O3 coating. Particle growth occurs during the subsequent heating with the majority of growth occurring at temperatures of 6 700 �C. The resultant particle size in the consolidated glass is equivalent to initial pore size in the glass, 10 � 1 nm, and the inter-particle spacing equivalent to the correlation length of the porous glass, 24 � 1 nm implying particle size and spacing are deﬁned by the morphology of the porous glass. The 10 � 1 nm diameter particles consist of an �8 nm diameter Fe0 core surrounded by 1 nm thick a-Fe2O3 cladding. Particle growth is accompanied by a decline in optical transparency and a conversion from superparamagnetism to ferromagnetism with the particles exhibiting a large coercivity. The latter is attributed to an exchange anisotropy between the Fe0 core and the oxide which becomes distributed throughout the body of the 10 � 1 nm diameter particles. � 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Initially uniformly distributed to at least a depth of P 4000 lm, as photolysis consumes the Fe(CO)5 in the outer volumes of glass; however, unreacted Fe(CO)5 diﬀuses from the interior to the outer volumes where it photochemically decomposes to Fe0 and Fe2O3 [6,14,15]. Immediately after pho- tolysis, the amount of iron in the outer 500–700 lm of the glass increases by a factor of approxi- mately three relative to that initially present. The maximum in iron occurs at 100 lm, while that at depths greater than 800–900 lm declines to less 10% of that initially present [16]. In spite of the change in distribution, it is not accompanied by particle growth. Transmission electron micro- scopy (TEM) of the photolyzed sample fails to reveal particles P 1 nm in diameter indicating that the Fe0 and Fe2O3 photoproducts exist either as individual molecular species, or small aggregates. The speciﬁc form of the photoproducts at this point is not known, but small aggregates, 6 1 nm in diameter, and composed of an Fe0 core sur- rounded by Fe2O3, appears to be the most likely form since M€ossbauer spectra show that the Fe0/ Fe2O3 ratio is insensitive to oxidants such as air, or water evolved during the consolidation of the glass [14]. Particle growth occurs during the subsequent heating, and with the exception of a slight change in iron distribution due to the 30–40% reduction in sample size during consolidation, it occurs with no measurable change in iron distribution in the glass. 3–4 nm diameter particles are evident after heating the samples to 650 �C (Fig. 1). Heating to 1200 �C consolidates the glass and increases particle size further (Fig. 2). Some variation in particle size and spacing is evident in Fig. 2, as well as what appear to be aggregates of two or more particles. How- ever, the variation is thought to arise from parti- cles at diﬀerent depths in the sample, while the clusters are attributed to superimposed images of individual particles at diﬀerent depths in the sam- ple since this is evident only in the thicker portions of the samples. In the ten samples examined in these experiments, containing 0:5 � 0:1% Fe by weight, the particles are individual and spherical with a median diameter of 10 � 1 nm (Fig. 3), and an average inter-particle spacing of 22 � 1 nm. Electronic spectra of the samples show that 50% T occurs in the 300–350 nm region immediately after photolysis, increases to the 450–500 nm re- gion after heating to 650 �C and then to the 600– 650 nm region after consolidating the glass at 1200 �C. M€ossbauer spectra of the sample after pho- tolysis, and after heating to 650 �C, consists of two doublets exhibiting isomer shifts of 0:52 � 0:01 and 0:13 � 0:01 mm/s, and quadrupole splittings of 0:64 � 0:01 and 0:58 � 0:01 mm/s [15]. No mag- netic hyperﬁne structure is present in M€ossbauer spectra, and the magnetization curves (Fig. 4(a)) do not exhibit hysterisis immediately after pho- tolysis, or after heating the sample to 650 �C. Both the photoproduct and the 3–4 nm diameter parti- cles (Fig. 1) exhibit superparamagnetism (Fig. 4(a)). Heating to 1200 �C consolidates the glass, and increases the particle size to 10 � 1 nm in Fig. 1. TEM micrograph of photolyzed sample after heating to 650 �C. 156 D.

M€ossbauer spectra of the con- solidated samples exhibit two overlapping six line spectra with isomer shifts of 0.13 and 0.57 mm/s relative to metallic iron and magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁelds of 370 and 425 kG [15]. The 10 � 1 nm di- ameter particles are ferromagnetic and exhibit a hysterisis corresponding to a coercivity of 965 kG (Fig. 4(b)). 4. Discussion Fe(CO)5 physisorbs onto PVG without disrup- tion or signiﬁcant distortion of its primary coor- dination sphere [22]. Photolysis of the adsorbed complex, designated Fe(CO)5 (ads), with 488 nm light leads to decomposition with a quantum eﬃ- ciency of 0:96 � 0:05 [22]. No intermediates per- sisting for more than a few milliseconds are detected in the presence of air, and exposure to CO fails to regenerate Fe(CO)5 (ads) indicating an ir- reversible oxidation of the adsorbed complex. Nevertheless, XANES and M€ossbauer analyses of the photolyzed sample indicate the presence of elemental iron, Fe0, and a-Fe2O3 in approximately equal amounts [14,15]. The Fe0/Fe2O3 ratio varies somewhat from sample to sample with 53–65% of the deposited iron present as elemental iron after photolysis. The ratio declines slightly during the subsequent heating and consolidation of the glass, Fig. 2. TEM micrograph of photolyzed sample after consoli- dating the glass at 1200 �C. Fig. 3. Distribution of particle diameters in samples consoli- dated at 1200 �C. D. Sunil et al. / Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids 319 (2003) 154–162 157 but M€ossbauer and XANES indicate that 42 � 12% of the iron in the consolidated glass re- mains as elemental iron [14]. The absence of complete oxidation of the iron in the consolidated glass suggests that Fe0 does not exist as an indi- vidual atoms since individual iron atoms would be spontaneously oxidized either by air during the subsequent heating, or water evolved during con- solidation of the glass [24,25]. Five-nm diameter iron particles generated in air, for example, react immediately to form 1–2 nm thick oxide coatings, which subsequently curtailed the rate of further oxidation [26]. The lack of complete oxidation in PVG during the subsequent heating and consoli- dation suggests that the photoproducts are small aggregates, 6 1 nm in diameter, containing an iron core surrounded by the oxide. X-ray microprobe analyses reveal a uniform distribution of Fe(CO)5 to a depth of P 4000 lm prior to photolysis [15,27]. Assuming a uniform distribution throughout the glass before photolysis [15,27], the surface area of PVG, 183 � 15 m2/g, and the projected area of Fe(CO)5 on the surface, 0.3 nm2/Fe(CO)5 (ads), [22] indicate the loadings examined in these experiments, 10�4 mol of Fe(CO)5/g, correspond to a fractional surface coverage of 0:10 � 0:01. However, photolysis in- creases the amount of iron near the surface of the sample, i.e., within the ﬁrst 100–200 lm, by a factor of approximately three, relative to that ini- tially present, and reduces that at depths greater than 800–900 lm to less 10% of that present ini- tially [16]. Time-resolved experiments establish that the change in iron distribution is due to dif- fusion of Fe(CO)5 during photolysis [22]. As the photochemical reaction consumes Fe(CO)5 in the outermost volumes of the glass, unreacted Fe(CO)5 diﬀuses from the interior of the glass to these outer volumes where it undergoes photoin- duced decomposition. The three fold increase in iron in the ﬁrst 100–200 lm increases the loading to 3 � 10�4 mol of Fe(CO)5/g in the outer volume, which corresponds to fractional surface coverage of �0.30 or 1 Fe(CO)5 molecule/nm2. This increase in surface coverage allows the growth of 6 1 nm diameter aggregates of Fe0 and Fe2O3 to occur via diﬀusion of no more than a few nanometers. Since Fe(CO)5 desorbs from the glass at a rel- ative low temperature, particle growth occurring during heating derives from the small aggregates created photochemically, as opposed to the ther- mal decomposition of the precursor. Furthermore, unlike the photochemical step, it occurs with no measurable change in iron distribution. Heating to 650 �C increases particle size to 3–4 nm in diameter (Fig. 2). If the particle consists of a central core of Fe0 surrounded by Fe2O3, the equivalence of the relative intensities of the M€ossbauer absorptions indicates equal numbers of iron atoms in the core and the cladding. Assuming their densities are equivalent to those of those of the bulk materials, 7.86 and 5.24 g/cm3, respectively, setting the quo- tients of the mass of each present divided by their densities equal to the volume of the 4 nm particle indicates the 3–4 nm diameter particles consist of a Fig. 4. Sample magnetization as a function of applied ﬁeld for samples heated to (a) 650 and (b) 1200 �C. 158 D. Sunil et al. / Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids 319 (2003) 154–162 2 nm diameter Fe0 core surrounded by 1 nm thick Fe2O3 layer. Although the data gathered in these experiments point to an oxide that most closely resembles a-Fe2O3, the result is consistent with previous studies which show that a 1 nm thick layer of Fe3O4 and/or c-Fe2O3 shields the under- lying elemental iron from further oxidation [26]. Formation of 3–4 nm diameter particles with no signiﬁcant change in the Fe0/Fe2O3 ratio implies aggregation occurs without compromising the in- tegrity of the oxide coating. The speciﬁc structure of the particle is not known, but assuming spher- ical particles composed of an iron core surrounded by the oxide, particle growth at these lower tem- peratures appears to be a simple aggregation of the individual photoproducts. Consolidating the glasses at 1200 �C increases the particle size to 10 � 1 nm (Fig. 3), which is within experimental error of the diameter of the cavities present in the original sample of PVG, 10 � 1 nm. Furthermore, the average inter-particle spacing, 22 � 1 nm, is equivalent to the correlation length of the porous glass, 24 � 2 nm [9,28]. The implication is the morphology of the porous glass controls the size of the particles and their spacing in the consolidated glass. This implies that the majority of particle growth must occur at tem- peratures below the softening point of the glass, which is about 700 �C [29]. Otherwise, loss of the original structure of the porous glass would be expected to produce a range of particle sizes and spacings. Particle growth within the cavities of the glass seems intuitive, but it is not mechanistically obvious how it occurs. Speciﬁcally, why does particle growth stop when the pores are ﬁlled and not continue within the interconnecting passages to produce a glass interlaced with Fe0 and a-Fe2O3 rather than the spherical 10 � 1 nm diameter particles evident in Fig. 2. The increased surface coverage created photochemically suggests that, at least in the outer volumes of the glass, particle growth may begin on all surfaces within the po- rous glass. However, the narrower passages col- lapse at faster rate than the larger pores, and the smaller particles within these narrow passages may be forced into the larger pores. When the pore is ﬁlled, consolidation forces the excess particles onto other cavities. This implies a range of smaller particles arising from the excess, but within the resolution of these experiments, there is no evi- dence of smaller particles, which leads us to sus- pect that particle growth is a chemical consequence of the composition of the pore and/or its surface, rather than a physical consequence of the structure of the glass. This is also supported by results ob- tained with other metal compounds. Similar changes in refractive index occur in glasses im- pregnated with (CH3)3SnI, for example [9,27]. However, X-ray microprobe analyses show no signiﬁcant change in tin distribution after photo- lysis, and TEM analyses fail to reveal any parti- cles P 1 nm in diameter after photolysis, or after heating and consolidation of the glass sug- gesting that particle size and distribution are not simply a function of the morphology of the support, but reﬂect instead the chemical nature of the surface and its interaction with the photo- product. The decline in optical transparency as well as the change from superparamagnetism to ferro- magnetism arise from the increase in particle size since both occur with little change in sample composition. The isomer shifts and quadrupole splittings of the photoproducts and the 3–4 nm diameter particles, 0:52 � 0:01 and 0:13 � 0:01 mm/s, and 0:64 � 0:01 and 0:58 � 0:01 mm/s, respectively, correspond to the values reported for a-Fe2O3 and Fe0 [15]. The photoproducts and the 3–4 nm diameter particles are superparamagnetic (Fig. 4(a)), but convert to a ferromagnetic material with a coercivity of 965 kG on consolidation as indicated by the appearance of overlapping six line spectra and magnetic hysterisis (Fig. 4(b)). Nev- ertheless, the isomer shifts, 0.13 and 0.57 mm/s, and magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁelds of 370 and 425 kG of the ferromagnetic material in the consolidated glass remain within the range of those reported for elemental iron and a-Fe2O3 [15,30–32]. Several investigators report six-line M€ossbauer spectra for similar sized iron particles in metallic glasses, but the iron content in those glasses, 10–15% by weight, is considerably larger than the <1% used in these experiments [33–35]. The relative intensi- ties of the M€ossbauer absorptions and the XANES show no change in the Fe0/a-Fe2O3 ratio indicat- ing that the changes in the optical and magnetic D. Sunil et al. / Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids 319 (2003) 154–162 159 properties are due to the change in particle size rather than a compositional change. The absence of ferromagnetism in the smaller 3–4 nm diameter particles is attributed to volume- dependent superparamagnetic relaxation. In small particles, the magnetic vector is not ﬁxed along the easy direction as in macroscopic particles, but ﬂuctuates. The relaxation time, s, of a magnetized particle of volume V is given by N�eel–Brown for- mula s ¼ s0 expðKV =kBT ) where kB is the Boltz- mann constant, and K is the anisotropy energy constant [36,37]. Neel estimated s0, the relaxation time of an isolated, hypothetical, symmetrical particle to be on the order of 10�9 s, [38] although in recent years, s0 is customarily taken to be 10�10 s [17–19,38]. The absence of a magnetic hyperﬁne splitting in the M€ossbauer spectrum of the 3–4 nm diameter particles at room temperature and at 20 K implies the M€ossbauer Larmor precession time (10�8 s) [39] exceeds the magnetic relaxation time thereby reducing the average magnetization of the particle to zero.

Introduction In recent decades, numerous researchers have paid attention to the study of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs). Magnetic IONs can be used in the ﬁelds of water puriﬁcation, biomedicine, optoelectron- ics, and chemistry [1–6]. Such nanoparticles with a large surface area and unique magnetic properties are a potential adsorbent for the removal of hazardous substances from water such as nitrates [7], strontium [5], dyes [8], heavy metals [9]. Magnetic adsorbents can be easily removed from water by using a magnetic ﬁeld gradient [10]. Magnetic nanoparticles with coated surface are promising materials that can be used for biomedical applications, including targeted drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhancement, magnetic hyperthermia and thermoablation, bioseparation and biosensing [11–13]. The practical application of iron oxide nanoparticles is often determined by their magnetic properties. A characteristic feature of most iron minerals is the diversity of their phase transitions and transformations, which results in corresponding changes in magnetic properties (e.g., magnetic susceptibility or Curie temperature). It is well known that hematite (a-Fe2O3) is resistant to high temperatures under oxidizing conditions, whereas under reducing conditions it can be converted to magnetite (Fe3O4) or maghemite (c-Fe2O3). However, the conditions of this transformation and the magnetic properties of the obtained sample are poorly deﬁned. Hanesch et al. [14] used thermomagnetic analysis to show that the presence of organic matter leads to the formation of maghe- mite or magnetite from hematite above 450 �C. Ellid et al. [15] found that chemical reduction of hematite with starch for 2 h at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apt.2020.04.021 0921-8831/� 2020 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

In our previous work [16], we have shown that the reduction of synthetic and natural hematite begins at about a tem- perature of 350 �C. The obtained magnetic samples revealed a sim- ilar Curie temperature but very different mass magnetization, which suggests a higher conversion fraction for the synthetic min- eral due to the larger surface area. When heated under oxidizing conditions, goethite (a-FeOOH) is converted to hematite. Because both minerals are antiferromag- netic, the magnetic susceptibility changes slightly. In contrast, under reducing conditions, goethite is converted to magnetite with a possible intermediate hematite formation. Experiments with the reduction of goethite are mainly devoted to natural coarse particles of goethite iron ores [17–19]. The reduction of nanoscale goethite has been studied in several papers. For example, Hanesch et al. [14] found that in the presence of glucose, goethite begins to turn into a high-magnetic mineral at 420 �C. We also compared the reduction of natural and synthetic goethites in [20] using thermo- magnetic analysis. The reduction with starch results in the forma- tion of magnetite at 270 �C from synthetic goethite and at 500 �C from brown goethite ore. An increase in the saturation magnetiza- tion was observed from < 1 Am2/kg to 70 Am2/kg for synthetic goethite and to 25 Am2/kg for natural goethite. Thermal decomposition of lepidocrocite (c-FeOOH) under oxi- dizing conditions has been well studied due to the formation of highly magnetic maghemite. Generally, lepidocrocite begins to transform to maghemite at 200 �C [21,22]. Gehring and Hofmeister [21] found that the structural conversion of lepidocrocite to maghemite starts at about 200 �C and is completed around 300 �C. At higher temperatures, maghemite is converted into hematite. The effect of reducing agents on the transformation of lepidocrocite has not been sufﬁciently studied. Hanesch et al. [14] have suggested that in the presence of organic carbon, the reaction of lepidocrocite starts at slightly lower temperatures and is somewhat stronger, but the end product is the same. Since the available data on the control of the magnetic proper- ties of iron oxide nanoparticles under the inﬂuence of oxidizing and reducing conditions are inconsistent and incomplete, addi- tional systematic studies can greatly assist the synthesis of nanoparticles with predetermined magnetic characteristics, as well as the selection of precursors and operating conditions, which can be signiﬁcant in laboratory and industrial settings. Therefore, the goal of this work is to study the changes in the magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles (i.e. hematite, goethite, lepidocrocite) when heated under both reducing and oxi- dizing conditions. The structure and magnetic properties of the obtained samples are investigated by thermomagnetic analysis, scanning electron microscopy, X-Ray diffraction and magnetome- try measurements. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Synthesis of initial IONs All reagents used in the synthesis were commercial products. Synthesis of lepidocrocite included dissolving 16.68 g of ferrous sulfate in 300 ml of distilled water with a magnetic stirrer. The pH of the solution varied in the range of 6.7–6.9. During the syn- thesis, 1 M sodium hydroxide was gradually added in order to maintain the pH at the required level. The solution was incubated at a room temperature accompanying with air blowing through the solution. The obtained precipitate was washed three times with distilled water using centrifuge and dried in the thermostat to con- stant mass. The duration of the experiment was 4 h and terminated when the color of the solution became yellow. A sample of synthetic goethite was synthesized using a solution of 0.48 M sodium hydrogen carbonate (50 ml) that was slowly poured under intensive stirring into the solution of 0.4 M iron (III) nitrate (50 ml), and then the resulting suspension was heated up to boiling and then cooled down. Afterwards, the solution of 5 M sodium hydroxide in 100 ml of distilled water was added into the suspension. The formed precipitate was stored in a thermostat for 24 h at a temperature of 90 �C. During this time, the precipitate was completely turned into crystalline light-yellow goethite. Hematite sample was synthesized through the thermal decom- position of synthetic goethite at 400 �C during 30 min in a quartz reactor isolated from atmospheric oxygen. 2.2. IONs thermal treatment The initial samples weighing up to 0.3 g were heated in a fur- nace at temperatures from 100 to 900 �C and for a time interval of 10–60 min. These conditions were chosen because most redox reactions of iron minerals occur within this temperature range, and 10–60 min is usually sufﬁcient to evaluate the effect of time at the laboratory level. Hematite and goethite were heated under reducing conditions, whereas lepidocrocite was treated under both reducing and oxidiz- ing conditions. The 5% of starch was mixed with the samples to simulate reducing conditions. The reducing conditions were used as an additional controller of the magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles due to the reaction Fe2+ to Fe3+ and vice versa. Previ- ous experience in addition to theoretical calculations indicates that 5% of starch is more than sufﬁcient to completely convert iron oxi- des and hydroxides into magnetite. The heat treatment was carried out in a quartz reactor with a diameter of 1 cm. After each phase transformation, the saturation magnetization was measured with an estimated error of 1.5 Am2/kg. 2.3. Methods of characterization The crystal structure and magnetic properties of initial and resulting samples have been described using X-Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, thermomagnetic analysis and mag- netometer measurements. X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out using diffractometer DRON-3 M in ﬁltered emission CuRa (k = 0.154184 nm) with recording geometry by Bregg-Brentano. The diffraction data cards were used for XRD phase diagnostics by d-spacing detecting. Magnetization measurements as a function of an applied ﬁeld was performed by magnetometer with the Hall sensors. The anal- ysis of the samples was carried out at a room temperature. An external magnetic ﬁeld of magnetometer varied in the range of 0 ± 0.45 T. Thermomagnetic curves were obtained with a custom-built facility consisting of a digital balance with a built-in permanent magnet. An applied permanent magnetic ﬁeld of 300 mT was used. The samples were heated and cooled in a quartz reactor isolated from atmospheric oxygen. The rate of heating and cooling of the samples was 65 �C/min. Thermomagnetic data include derivative thermomagnetic curves (DTMC) and integral thermomagnetic curves (TMC). A ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope JSM-6700F (‘‘JEOL”) was used to determine the morphology and size of iron oxide nanoparticles. Before imaging, the samples were coated with a platinum ﬁlm of 30 Å in thickness using sputtering method. Operating conditions of imaging were as follows: SE mode, 10 kV accelerating voltage and 0.65 nA beam current. 2588 V.P. Ponomar et al. / Advanced Powder Technology 31 (2020) 2587–2596 3.

For that, clusters of iron oxide nanoparticles of different cluster size (46–240 nm diameter range) were synthesized by a solvothermal method and fully characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spec- troscopy. The rheological behavior of the optimal nanoﬂuids was also studied by rotational rheometry. The nanoﬂuids were obtained by dispersing the clusters of iron oxide nanoparticles in water taking into account different solid volume fractions (from 0.50 to 1.5 wt%) and the experiments were conducted in the temperature range from 293.15 K to 313.15 K. The study reveals and quantiﬁes enhancements in the thermal conductivity of nanoﬂuid with increase of cluster size and temperature. Furthermore, a 0.50 wt% concentration of clusters of iron oxide nanoparticles within the whole range of proposed nanoﬂuids offers great stability and improved thermal conductivity for heat transfer applications with an small dynamic viscosity increase. In addition, the larger the size of the clusters of iron oxide nanoparticles, the greater the increase in thermal conductivity for the designed Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 cluster-based nanoﬂuids, with ther- mal conductivity values following a constant upward trend and reaching a maximum increase of 4.4% for the largest synthesized clusters (average size of 240 nm).

Introduction The increasing demand of energy across the world has become a critical issue in our nowadays society. Limited fossil fuel, and its side effects largely contributing to air pollution, has forced the searching of alternative clean sources and the reduction in con- sumption of this fossil fuel through increasing efﬁciency of existing energy systems [1]. For instance, decreasing energy consumption based on enhancing ﬂuids heat transfer efﬁciency has become a huge challenge, taking into account the main objectives of engi- neering and industry [2,3]. This objective should address for exam- ple the performance of the heat exchangers, that can be considerably enhanced by improving the thermal conductivity of working ﬂuids [4–7]. Nanoﬂuids, colloidal suspensions of nanoparticles or nanostruc- tures in liquid carrier ﬂuids as water, ethylene glycol and engine oil, contribute to exhibit a large thermal conductivity (TC) [8], of which the next generation heat transfer ﬂuids can beneﬁt, when applied in microelectronics, or for energy supply [6,9–11]. Indeed, a TC enhancement upon the dispersion of nanoparticles into a base ﬂuid has been previously studied for heat transfer [8,12–15], and there are many different examples reporting improvements in the values of TC when using metallic (Fe, Cu) or metal oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles, at different concentrations, at different tem- peratures, using different average sizes and even taking into account the inﬂuence of an external magnetic ﬁeld [2,11,16]. In this regard, different authors reported non-dependence in the enhancement ratios of this property with the increasing tempera- ture. As an example, in the case of Fe3O4 nanoﬂuids, the works by Parekh and Lee [17], Yu et al. [18] or Fu et al. [3] should be men- tioned. On the contrary, some authors showed strong dependences of the thermal conductivity enhancement ratio with the increasing https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molliq.2021.117727 0167-7322/� 2021 The Author(s).

In the latter cases, the trends are especially prominent for high nanoparticle concen- trations and high temperatures, where agglomeration or aggre- gates may have inﬂuenced the ﬁnal results. On this topic, it is particularly important to take into account that the particles stability in the suspension is key and accordingly, considerable research has been conducted in this regard [20,21]. However, given the fact that there is no control in the likely aggre- gation of the nanoparticles above a threshold concentration when dispersed in these ﬂuids designed to work in heat exchangers, the effects a controlled aggregation can exert in the nanoﬂuids thermal properties have not been studied so far. Appropriately, herein we report for the ﬁrst time the use of a spherical assembly of iron oxide nanoparticles of controlled size, i.e. Cluster of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (CION), such that we can study the inﬂuence of this controlled aggregation in the ﬁnal effective TC and be able to pro- pose tuned nanoﬂuids using these particular nanostructures. For that, we have synthesized CION with tailored average sizes (from 46 to 240 nm) using a solvothermal method, and have fully charac- terized them by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffrac- tion and Raman spectroscopy. The chosen clusters were dispersed in water to obtain aqueous nanoﬂuids using different concentrations, of which the thermal conductivities and dynamic viscosities were obtained through the herein detailed careful analysis. 2. Experimental section 2.1. Chemicals Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3�6H2O (>99%), sodium acet- ate (>99%), poly(ethylene glycol) (MW 6000, PEG6000), ethylene glycol (>99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Water (Milli-Q). All chemicals were used as received. 2.2. Synthesis of clusters of Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 nanoparticles The synthesis of clusters of iron oxide (Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3) nanopar- ticles tuning the ﬁnal size of the clusters was conducted through a synthetic procedure published elsewhere [22]. For the ﬁve types of clusters under consideration; 2.5 mmol (0.678 g) of FeCl3�6H2O were dissolved in 20 mL of ethylene glycol, and mechanically stir- red up to form a clear solution, followed by the addition of sodium acetate (1.8 g) and PEG, in ﬁve independent experiments. For tun- ing the ﬁnal size of the clusters, the amount of PEG employed was 12.5 wt%, 8.5 wt%, 2.5 wt%, 8 wt%, and 2.5 wt%, such that 46 nm (cluster A), 70 nm (cluster B), 111 nm (cluster C), 178 nm (cluster D), and 240 nm (cluster E) average diameter clusters were obtained, respectively. In all cases, the mixture was ﬁrst homoge- nized, and then sealed in a stainless steel autoclave (100 mL). The autoclave was heated up to 458.15 K (heating rate: 5 K/min) while mechanically stirring (1500 rpm for clusters A, B and C and 800 rpm for clusters D and E) the solution for 8 h. Finally, the mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature and the black product was collected using a magnet. The clusters were then washed several times with Milli-Q water and dried overnight at 333.15 K in an oven, such that ﬁve different clusters of magnetic nanoparticles were available. 2.3. Preparation of aqueous nanoﬂuids using clusters of Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 nanoparticles Different nanoﬂuids were prepared dispersing clusters A, B, C, D and E in Milli-Q water, using a 0.50 wt% mass fraction in all the cases (0.50 wt% nanoﬂuid A, 0.50 wt% nanoﬂuid B, 0.50 wt% nano- ﬂuid C, 0.50 wt% nanoﬂuid D, and 0.50 wt% nanoﬂuid E). Further- more, nanoﬂuids using a 0.10 wt% mass fraction of clusters A and D (0.10 wt% nanoﬂuid A and 0.10 wt% nanoﬂuid D) and additional mass fractions of clusters E (1.0 and 1.5 wt%) were also considered (1.0 wt% nanoﬂuid E, and 1.5 wt% nanoﬂuid E). 2.4. Characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a JEOL JEM 1010 instrument (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Samples for the TEM analysis were prepared by dropping a diluted suspension of the clusters onto an ultrathin carbon-coated copper grid. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected by using a Siemens D- 5000 powder X-ray diffractometer (CuKa radiation (k = 1.54056 Å) in the range 2h = 5–100�) and compared with the crystallographic information ﬁles (CIF) from the crystallographic open data base (COD). Raman spectra were collected in powder samples onto a glass slide as substrate, with a Renishaw in Via Reﬂex Raman Microscope (Renishaw, Gloucestershire, UK). Experiments were conducted at room temperature by using an excitation wavelength of 633 nm. The stability of the dispersions was evaluated by zeta potential and dynamic light scattering analyses using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, United Kingdom). The zeta potential was determined for 0.10 wt% CION-based aqueous nanoﬂuids with cluster sizes of 46 and 178 nm (clusters A and D, respectively) at different temperatures in the range from 283.15 K to 323.15 K. The apparent sizes of the nanoadditives within these same dispersions were determined for 30 days at 298.15 K, using a dispersion angle of 173�. For each different- sized dispersion, two samples were analyzed under different con- ditions. One of them remained in static conditions from prepara- tion throughout the measurement period (hereinafter, static dispersion). The other sample was mechanically shaken for 1 min at 2000 rpm prior to the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measure- ment (hereinafter, shaken dispersion) using a ZX3 Advanced Vor- tex Mixer (VELP Scientiﬁca SRL, UsmateVelate, Italy). The thermal conductivity (TC) of nanoﬂuids and base ﬂuid was experimentally determined in the temperature range from 293.15 K to 313.15 K by a THW-L2 thermal conductivity-meter (Thermtest Inc., New Brunswick, Canada) coupled with an EchoTherm IC20XR dry bath that allows the temperature control using Peltier technology. The operation of this device is based on the transient short-hot-wire (SHW) technique, in accordance with the ASTM D7896-14 standard [23]. The aluminum wire is 60 mm long and 0.1 mm in diameter. It is inserted vertically into the con- tainer with 18 mL of sample inside. The whole assembly is placed on the dry bath, covered with an insulating case, and the necessary time is waited to achieve the desired temperature. An initial power test serves to adjust the heating power required to produce the local temperature rise necessary for the measurement in a short period of time (�2 s), avoiding natural convection phenomena. The adequacy and precision of this device for nanoﬂuids has been previously validated elsewhere [24–26]. Five tests were made per sample and temperature, in order to ensure the repeatability of the values, waiting 3 min between measurements. The expanded uncertainty of the values obtained through this device is declared as 2%. The rheological behavior of nanoﬂuids and base ﬂuid was stud- ied at 293.15 K by a Physica MCR 101 rotational rheometer (Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) coupled with a CP50-1 cone-plate geometry (diameter = 50 mm, cone angle = 1�, cone truncation = 102 lm). The temperature of the sample was stablished by a P-PTD 200 Pel- tier system, waiting a stabilization period of at least 100 s before operating. The test procedure consisted of obtaining the ﬂow A. Elsaidy, J.P. Vallejo, Verónica Salgueiriño et al. Journal of Molecular Liquids 344 (2021) 117727 2 curves of the samples in the shear rate range from 1 to 1000 s�1 with 10 point per decade. The expanded uncertainty of the dynamic viscosity measurements is 3%. 3. Results and discussion The clusters of iron oxide (Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3) nanoparticles herein studied were obtained through a solvothermal method, by which the mechanism of formation proceeds via a two-stage growth pro- cess, with nucleation of primary nanocrystals followed by uniform and controlled aggregation into larger secondary nanostructures [27]. This process to obtain CION with tuned size (the ﬁnal size of the clusters and of the nanoparticles forming them) depends mainly on the poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) concentration in the reaction medium [22]. Fig. 1 includes the TEM and the size distri- bution analysis (Gaussian ﬁt) of the ﬁve different types of clusters under consideration, from now on (color-coded) clusters A, B, C, D, and E with average diameters of 46 ± 14 nm, 70 ± 19 nm, 111 ± 21 nm, 178 ± 21 nm, and 240 ± 37 nm, respectively. Fig. 2 includes the structural characterization of the ﬁve types of clusters, taking into account X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD analysis of these clusters shows ﬁve similar patterns (Fig. 2a), on which we observe well-deﬁned peaks that correspond to a spinel structure, though with different noise attending to the different size of the crystalline domains forming part of the nanoparticles in the ﬁnal clusters [27]. Since the XRD data of spinels (i.e. maghemite, magnetite or other transition metal ferrites) show very similar diffraction patterns because all of them Fig. 1.

XRD patterns (a) and Raman spectra registered using a 633 nm excitation wavelength (b) of clusters A, B, C, D, and E. A. Elsaidy, J.P. Vallejo, Verónica Salgueiriño et al. Journal of Molecular Liquids 344 (2021) 117727 3 share the same crystalline structure, we have further characterized the powders of clusters using Raman spectroscopy. This technique is a powerful means to investigate structural properties of materi- als, and can provide unique information when analyzing nanos- tructured transition metal oxides [28], as registering the different vibrations due to different cationic arrangements [29]. In the par- ticular case under study, with a magnetic iron oxide phase prone to oxidation, we have used an excitation wavelength of 633 nm to achieve a satisfactory penetration depth while avoiding any fur- ther oxidation of the clusters. Attending to the Raman spectra obtained for the samples, we have included in the graph in Fig. 2b the expected group theory vibration modes of both mag- netite (Fe3O4, vertical dotted lines) and maghemite (c-Fe2O3, shaded grey areas) iron oxides phases. That is, ﬁve main bands appearing at 196, 306, 460, 538 and 668 cm�1, corresponding to the T2g (1), Eg, T2g (2),T2g (3),and A1g modes of magnetite, respec- tively, and three broad bands centered at 350, 500 and 700 cm�1, corresponding to the T2g, Eg and A1g modes of maghemite, respec- tively [30,31]. According to this, the Raman spectra conﬁrm the presence of both oxides in the ﬁve types of clusters, considering the very intense A1g band of magnetite and the three main bands of the maghemite (present in all the cases), though likely with a different ratio of iron oxide phases. In this regard, other character- istic features of the materials like the black coloration of its pow- ders and their strong interaction with external magnetic ﬁelds were also observed. Fig. 3a shows the quasi-constant zeta potential values obtained for the dispersions of different-sized CION at the analysed temper- atures. This trend implies that there are no remarkable differences in the intensity of the electrostatic repulsion forces among the nanoadditives in the temperature range analysed. Therefore, simi- lar conditions can be inferred in relation to the stability of the dis- persions. Generally, absolute zeta potential values>30 mV are considered a symptom of stability of nanoﬂuids in the literature [32–34]. Furthermore, it is also implied that the higher this value, the greater the dispersion stability, due to higher electrostatic repulsion forces between clusters, which avoid coalescence between them and subsequent sedimentation. The average zeta potential values are 39.1 and 30.1 mV for the clusters with average diameters of 46 nm (0.10 wt% nanoﬂuid A) and 178 nm (0.10 wt% nanoﬂuid D), respectively. Both values exceed the threshold of 30 mV, considered a sign of moderate stability. A relationship can be observed between the increase in the size of the clusters and the decrease in the value of the zeta potential.

As naturally anticipated from the fact  that magnetic properties of crystals are intimately  related to the site distribution of magnetic ions as  well as crystal structure, it is thought that mag-  * Corresponding author. netic properties of amorphous solids are influ-  enced by the local structure around magnetic ions  and their distribution states over a long range. The present authors have been investigating the  chemical structure of iron-containing amorphous  solids, in particular, oxide glasses from such a  standpoint [1-8]. ","Results  3.1. Crystal structure and magnetic properties of  as-quenched specimens  2. Experimental  Reagent-grade ZnO and Fe20 3 were mixed  thoroughly so as to make compositions of (100 -  x)ZnO.xFe20 3 with x=30 to 90 tool%. The  mixture was calcined at 900°C for 30 min; this  procedure was repeated twice. The resultant  powders were pressed under a hydrostatic pres-  sure of about 10 MPa and sintered in air at 900°C  for 30 rain. The sintered body was melted in an  image furnace with a Xe-lamp as the heat source. The melt was quenched by being dropped onto a  twin-roller made of stainless steel which was ro-  tating at 3000 rpm. The resultant specimen was a  thin foil of about 20 p~m thick. The as-quenched  specimens were subjected to heat treatment at  500 to 900°C for 2 h in air. The X-ray diffraction  analysis with CuKcx radiation was carried out for  both as-quenched and heat-treated specimens in  order to identify the crystalline phases precipi-  tated and to estimate the lattice constants of the  crystalline phases. Practical compositions of the specimens deter-  mined by the chemical analysis are shown along  with the nominal compositions in Table 1. Strictly  speaking, the representation of the practical com-  position like 65ZnO-35Fe20 3 is not correct be-  cause the specimens contain Fe 2+ as well as  Fe 3+ ions. In all the specimens examined, the  concentration of ZnO in the practical composi-  tion is smaller than that in the nominal composi-  tion, presumably because of vaporization of ZnO  during the melting process in the image furnace.

The assignments of the diffraction  peaks are presented in the figure. Crystalline phases with spinel structure are ob-  served in all the specimens, although the intensity  of the diffraction peaks varies with composition. Only the diffraction peaks assigned to crystal with  spinel structure are observed in the specimen  with 10ZnO.90Fe203 composition. In the as-  quenched specimens with other compositions, et-  Fe203 (hematite) and ZnO were precipitated in  addition to the crystalline phases with spinel  structure. As the concentration of Fe203 in the  specimens decreases, the intensity of the diffrac-  tion peaks of ct-Fe203 and ZnO increases. From  the positions of diffraction peaks of the crystal  with spinel structure, lattice constants were eval-  uated. The compositional dependence of the lat-  tice constant for the crystal with spinel structure  is shown in Fig. 3. The lattice constants of Fe304  (magnetite) and ZnFe204 (franklinite), cited from  the Powd'~r Diffraction File compiled by JCPDS  (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Stan-  dards), are also shown. The lattice constants of  the crystals with-spinel structure in the specimens  with 70ZnO-30Fe203 and 60ZnO-40Fe203  compositions are almost identical with that of  franklinite. The lattice constant decreases mono-  tonically with an increase in the concentration of  Fe203, and approaches the lattice constant of  magnetite.

The compositional dependence of magnetization at  room temperature for the Zn-Fe-O system prepared by the  twin-roller method. The magnetization of Fe304 is also pre-  sented. Fig. 4 shows the compositional dependence of  magnetization at room temperature. The magne-  tization of magnetite is also shown in this figure. The magnetization increases monotonically with  an increase in concentration of Fe203, and ap-  proaches the value of magnetite. It should be  noted that the magnetization of 70ZnO • 30Fe203,  where a ferrite with lattice constant similar to  that of ZnFe204 precipitates, is relatively high. Since ZnFe204 with normal spinel structure is  antiferromagnetic with a N6el temperature of  about 10 K [15], the structure of the ferrite pre-  cipitated in the specimen with 70ZnO"" 30Fe203  composition is different than the normal spinel  structure. Room temperature M6ssbauer spectra of  as-quenched 50ZnO.50Fe203  and 10ZnO. 90Fe203 are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. The M6ssbauer spectrum of the 50ZnO • 50Fe203  is composed of paramagnetic and ferromagnetic  components. The ferromagnetic component man-  ifests very broad linewidths. The intense para-  magnetic absorption peak around 0.4 mm/s is  attributed to Fe 3+ ions. A close look at Fig. 5  reveals that a weak absorption is observed around  1.3 mm/s as a shoulder of the intense paramag-  netic peak. This absorption is assigned to Fe 2+  ions.
